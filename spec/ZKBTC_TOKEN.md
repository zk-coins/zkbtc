# zkBTC — Permissionless Deposit-Backed Redeemable BTC on zkCoins (Optional Gatekeeper)

**Status:** Design specification. No code. **Buildable on today's Bitcoin — no soft-fork.** The normative fraud-proof verifier is **BitVM2** (mainnet-proven; reference exemplar: Citrea Clementine, live since 2026-01; Bitlayer BitVM bridge mainnet since 2025-07). Remaining work is **two tracks**: (a) the **Plonky2 → BitVM2 (SNARK/Groth16) conversion of the zkCoins compliance predicate** (§4.0 / §4.6B / M3), and (b) instantiating and hardening the **open operator-registration market** (policy encoding, bond / anti-domination calibration, `reg_root_E` format, ceremony robustness — semantic requirements in §4.1.2; calibration still open per §11 / §4.6A). Both §4.6A REQ-4 gates and §4.6B maturity gates **MUST** clear. zkBTC is a substantial engineering project (Citrea-class, order of months) built on **proven** components — not speculative research and not contingent on any not-yet-mainnet construction. Glock / BitVM3 / Mosaic are retained only as **§10 future efficiency upgrades** (BitVM3/Mosaic/Argo preserve permissionless challenge; Glock carries a designated-verifier trade-off — §10.1).

**Authoritative source for:** the zkBTC token standard (token standard 3, `issuance_version == 3`) and the zkBTC bridge profile (permissionless minting with optional gatekeeper quality control at peg-in; gatekeeper-independent peg-out).

**Audience:** protocol engineers and organisations evaluating zkBTC deployment (as minters, optional gatekeepers, or operators).

**Supersedes:**
- [`BRIDGE_MVP.md`](./BRIDGE_MVP.md) §4 / §6.3 (separate `IssuanceProof` / `BurnProof` ProofTypes and global `peg_in_consumed_smt` / `burned_coins_smt` — incompatible with the post-#97 nullifier model, with specification.md §6.5's version-branch dispatch, and with §2.2's single-circuit rule);
- the `IssuanceTerms_v2_glock_bridged` sketch in [`../bitvm-bridge-research.md`](../bitvm-bridge-research.md) (issuer-less, and `issuance_version == 2` is now the capped-supply standard in specification.md §6.5);
- the single-issuer framing of earlier drafts of this document (replaced by permissionless issuance with an optional mint gatekeeper — §1.1 REQ-3, §6).

**Note:** Written against zk-coins/docs `develop` @ e3b5d04 (post-#97 on-chain nullifier `(Pkᵢ, Rᵢ)`, half-aggregation, v1 freeze). Normative keywords (**MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **SHOULD**, **MAY**) follow RFC 2119. The June-2026 Glock-path decision recorded in [`../bitvm-bridge-research.md`](../bitvm-bridge-research.md) is **historical** and is superseded by the works-today BitVM2 decision (§4.0); Glock remains only as a §10.1 efficiency-upgrade option.

## 1. Requirements and scope

### 1.1 Product requirements

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| **REQ-1** | zkBTC is a zkCoins asset: an ordinary multi-asset coin under the protocol's `asset_id` model, verified by the same circuit `C` and nullifier accumulator as every other asset. |
| **REQ-2** | Free transfer: once minted, any holder **MAY** send zkBTC to any other address without gatekeeper permission, signature, or online cooperation. |
| **REQ-3** | **Permissionless issuance with an optional mint gatekeeper.** Anyone **MAY** create a zkBTC-style asset and act as a **minter**. An asset **MAY** designate a **gatekeeper** whose per-mint approval is mandatory; the gatekeeper does entry quality control, is the **canonical-chain anchor** for mint settlement covering **`MoveToBacked` and `reg_root_E`** (R-04 / Attack A), and issues the **operator-set-diversity vouch** (R-08 / Attack B) (§3.2.1.1, §6.1), and represents the interests of the asset's existing holders. Minting economic activity and gatekeeping are separate roles. **A trust-minimized pooled cross-graph zkBTC effectively REQUIRES a gatekeeper (or an equivalent canonical-oracle role)** for R-04 **and** R-08 — **Corner A** of the sound-deployment trilemma (§5, §6.4, §3.2.1.2); no-gatekeeper + open registration + pooled cross-graph is **Corner C / UNSOUND** and **MUST NOT** be presented as trust-minimized pooled backing. |
| **REQ-4** | **Gatekeeper-independent, open-operator, liveness-bounded redemption:** every holder **MUST** be able to redeem for on-chain BTC without the gatekeeper's permission or technical cooperation. The exit (peg-out) agent role is **open and permissionless** — anyone **MAY** register (bond + pubkey, §4.1.1) and serve exits, including a holder acting as **their own** exit agent. Exit depends only on the liveness of **≥1 registered operator** (BitVM-family residual — §1.2, §4.3), never on a fixed or privileged operator, and no operator can steal (1-of-N setup honesty + ≥1 honest live challenger acting in-window — worst case freeze/burn; §5). High minimum denominations and multi-week wait windows are acceptable for emergency exit. |

### 1.2 Honest impossibility statement

No currently deployed mechanism gives a fungible multi-holder BTC-backed token a pure third-party-free unilateral L1 exit the way a Lightning force-close or a statecoin backup does. Federated and threshold-signer pegs (Liquid, tBTC, sBTC, and similar) require a signer quorum to release BTC. BitVM-family bridges improve **safety** toward 1-of-N setup honesty with challenge games, but keep **withdrawal liveness** dependent on at least one rational operator who fronts funds. Statechains and Ark offer unilateral exit for discrete UTXO/VTXO claims, not for a free-transfer fungible multi-holder token. Covenant soft forks that would enable anyone-can-satisfy vault exits are not activated as of mid-2026.

**Open-operator resolution.** On today's Bitcoin the exit-agent role can be made fully **open and permissionless** — anyone **MAY** post a bond and register as an operator for a deposit epoch (§4.1.1), so a holder can be **their own** exit agent and no operator set is a closed club. What is NOT achievable without a covenant soft-fork is *registration-free* unilateral self-reclaim: a holder who never registers relies on ≥1 *registered* operator being online to front and reclaim (a liveness dependency, not custody — that operator cannot steal under 1-of-N + ≥1 honest live challenger acting in-window (§5)). This design delivers the maximal open-operator property available on today's Bitcoin and states the registration-free residual plainly (§10) rather than masking it.

REQ-4 as stated demands **gatekeeper-independence** (and, more generally, independence from any mint-time quality authority), which this design achieves: the gatekeeper has no role in peg-out. Full **counterparty-freeness** (zero live third parties other than Bitcoin) is not achievable for a fungible multi-holder token on today's Bitcoin; that residual needs covenant soft forks (§10). This document states that residual plainly rather than masking it.

### 1.3 Mechanism-class → unilateral-exit verdict

Compressed from the landscape matrix (research landscape report §3):

| Mechanism class | Unilateral exit (holder vs L1 vault) | Fit for REQ-4 |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------|---------------|
| BitVM2 / BitVM3 / Glock operator-fronted peg | **PARTIAL** — safety 1-of-N; liveness needs ≥1 operator | **Chosen path (works today; open operator registration §4.1.1):** BitVM2 is the normative works-today verifier; BitVM3/Glock are future efficiency variants (§10.1) |
| Federated / threshold (Liquid, tBTC, sBTC, Spiderchain) | **NO** — quorum releases BTC | Out |
| Mercury statechains | **YES** per UTXO, not fungible multi-holder | Poor fungibility fit |
| Ark / Arkade VTXO | **YES** / **PARTIAL** while unexpired; expiry liveness | Secondary rail, not reserve |
| Lightning channels | **YES** for channel parties; **N/A** as multi-holder peg | Not a shared-reserve token |
| Covenant vaults (CTV / CSFS / OP_CAT) | **YES** (design-space) after activation | Long-term registration-free-exit upgrade (§10.2) |
| Custodial mints (Fedimint / Cashu) | **NO** | Contrast only |

### 1.4 Scope boundaries

This document defines:

- the in-circuit token standard that makes mint and redeem statements machine-checkable;
- the off-circuit bridge profile that holds the BTC reserve and serves exits;
- the trust matrix, launch gates, gatekeeper/compliance model, and transitional naming lock;
- future efficiency and covenant upgrade paths as design optionality, not delivery dependencies.

This document does **not** define:

- operator runbooks, federation recruitment, or commercial SLAs beyond the transitional profile;
- concrete Plonky2 circuit gadgets (only the statements they must prove);
- mainnet parameter freezes (values marked `PROVISIONAL` until **BitVM2 launch-pin against live economics**);
- a roadmap sequencing commitment relative to zkCoins native-issuance work (ROADMAP treats a BTC peg as orthogonal).

### 1.5 Non-goals

- **No new v1 wire formats.** Token standard 3 lives on the v2 circuit surface (new digests, new lineages). The frozen v1 surface of specification.md §1.7.8 is not edited in place.
- **No peg-in/out L1-footprint privacy beyond §8.** Deposits and payouts are public Bitcoin events; internal transfers remain shielded.
- **No price or oracle logic.** zkBTC is a claim on BTC at 1:1 denomination amounts, not a synthetic or stablecoin with external price feeds.
- **No federation-multisig V0** as a product path. **BitVM2 is the normative verifier** (§4.0); BitVM3 / Glock / Mosaic are optional **future efficiency upgrades** only (§10), never launch dependencies.
- **No claim of zero third-party dependency at exit.** REQ-4 is gatekeeper-independence and operator-liveness-bounded exit; operator liveness remains a residual (§4.3, §5). Operators **cannot steal** vault BTC under 1-of-N setup honesty + ≥1 honest live challenger acting within every relevant challenge window — worst case is freeze/burn (§4.1, §5 residual 3); else unchallenged-fraud drain (§3.6). The operator set is **open/permissionless** (§4.1.1), so the residual is *operator liveness*, not a privileged party.
- **No mandatory central mint authority at the protocol layer.** A gatekeeper is optional per asset (`gatekeeper = 0³²` is valid). When present, the gatekeeper is an entry quality filter, the **canonical-chain anchor** (R-04: `MoveToBacked` **and** `reg_root_E`), and the **operator-set-diversity vouch** (R-08) for mint settlement (§3.2.1.1, §6.1). **Trust-minimized open-registration pooled cross-graph backing effectively REQUIRES a gatekeeper (or equivalent canonical oracle)** for both R-04 and R-08 (**Corner A**); no-gatekeeper + open registration + pooled cross-graph is **Corner C / UNSOUND** and **MUST NOT** be marketed as trust-minimized (§3.2.1.2, §5, §6.4).

## 2. Design summary

zkBTC has two normative halves:

1. **Token standard 3 (TS3)** — in-circuit rules inside the single PCD circuit `C` (`issuance_version == 3`). Every mint is bound to a unique confirmed **`MoveToBacked` transaction** that creates a **backing-only vault output** (N-of-N-authenticated, deep-finality, operator-set membership; no refund path on that output); every redeem is an ordinary holder transition that anchors a unique on-chain nullifier `(Pkᵢ, Rᵢ)` and a hiding `redeem_commitment`.
2. **zkBTC bridge profile** — off-circuit **BitVM2**-based (BitVM-family) construction that holds the BTC reserve. Peg-in is permissionless for minters, optionally gated by a per-asset gatekeeper that is entry quality filter, **canonical-chain anchor** (R-04 / Attack A), and **operator-set-diversity vouch** (R-08 / Attack B) for mint settlement (REQ-3). Peg-out is gatekeeper-independent (REQ-4), operator-fronted (liveness only — operators **cannot steal** under 1-of-N + ≥1 honest live challenger acting in-window (§5)), with **optimistic assert/challenge/disprove** reimbursement and **permissionless challenging** (BitVM2 core property; availability ≠ guaranteed action — §4.1 role-note (a)).

Document order follows the advisor Q3 rule: token standard first (defines the statements), bridge second (consumes them). The bridge never invents a parallel mint/burn semantics; it only materialises Bitcoin custody around statements the circuit already enforces.

### 2.1 Roles (minter and optional gatekeeper)

Two mint-time roles are separated. They **MUST NOT** be conflated with a single central "issuer."

| Role | Function | Authority |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **Minter** | Economic actor: locks BTC (for zkBTC), obtains a mint to a recipient it commits. **MAY** be any depositor (permissionless). | Business activity only; no protocol veto over other holders' coins |
| **Gatekeeper** (optional) | Designated blockchain address — an x-only BIP-340 key; **MAY** be a MuSig2/FROST **threshold** aggregate of a holder committee (still a single x-only key in-circuit). Per-mint approval is mandatory when designated. Performs **three load-bearing roles** (§6.1, §3.2.1.1): (a) **source-of-funds / vault-legitimacy screening**, (b) **canonical-chain anchor (R-04)** — withholds the `Pk_mint` mint-settlement signature until **both** `MoveToBacked` **and** the epoch's `reg_root_E` are confirmed on the gatekeeper's **own canonical Bitcoin view** (closes R-04 / Attack A for both anchors), and (c) **operator-set-diversity vouch (R-08)** — refuses to sign a mint unless the backing epoch's operator set has **at least one independent honest signer (1-of-N-honest basis)** (closes Attack B / self-controlled Sybil-epoch drain). | Entry filter + mint-settlement canonicity gate + diversity vouch; **cannot mint without valid backing** (deposit + operator-set-legit clauses) and **cannot redirect another depositor's committed mint** (clause (g)); has no special minting privilege beyond any depositor; **cannot** freeze, claw back, or touch existing / circulating coins, and **cannot** block exit (REQ-4 intact). **When the gatekeeper performs R-04/R-08 honestly:** it cannot inflate; **cannot settle a mint against a non-canonical `MoveToBacked` or substituted `reg_root_E`** (withholds `sk_mint` until canonical confirmation of both); **cannot settle a mint against a self-controlled Sybil epoch** (withholds `sk_mint` unless R-08 diversity holds). A **compromised / negligent** gatekeeper that **skips** R-04/R-08 **can enable Attack A and Attack B** (backing drain via the redeem path) — so gatekeeper **integrity** is a **backing-safety dependency** (§6.3); it still **cannot** directly forge a vault spend, steal circulating coins, freeze, or block exit |

The asset **MAY** set `gatekeeper` to the all-zero sentinel (= no gatekeeper). Then minting is fully permissionless under depositor-anchored `Pk_mint` (§3.2) and structural operator-set legitimacy (§3.1). **Honest limitation (R-04 + R-08 / §6.4):** without a gatekeeper (or equivalent external canonical+diversity oracle) there is **no external canonical observer** at mint settlement (Attack A **not cleanly closed** — operator-oracle-only; closing the operator set does **not** close Attack A) and, under open registration, **no operator-set-diversity vouch** (Attack B open). No-gatekeeper + open registration + pooled is **Corner C / UNSOUND**; no-gatekeeper + closed enumerated set + pooled is **Corner B / materially weaker, not clean**. **There is no fully-clean no-gatekeeper profile for a pooled cross-graph reserve** (§3.2.1.2 / §5 residual 9 / §6.4).

A gatekeeper **MAY** also act as a depositor/minter for the same asset, subject to the **same** mint clauses as any other depositor — it has no special minting privilege.

The **vault presigning / operator set** (keys that co-sign the pre-signed **BitVM2** graph at setup and whose aggregate identity `agg_key` is admitted by `operator_set_root`) **MUST** be **N-of-N** (MUST — NEW-01). All operators **MUST** sign the graph at setup, and all **MUST** delete their signing shares afterward. Under 1-of-N setup honesty, **one honest deletion** prevents any further graph signing — a `t < N` threshold would leave `N−1 ≥ t` shares able to sign after one honest deletion and would **break** 1-of-N safety. A live `t-of-n` CHECKSIG on the vault is already forbidden (§3.1.1); the presigning set itself **MUST NOT** be threshold either.

**Operator role in one sentence:** the operator is a **1-of-N liveness / fronting role that CANNOT steal vault BTC** under 1-of-N setup honesty + **at least one honest, live challenger actually acting within every relevant challenge window** (§5 residual 3). **Permissionless challenge** (BitVM2 — anyone **MAY** challenge a fraudulent reimbursement) is what makes challenging *possible* for anyone; safety requires someone to actually *do* it (availability ≠ guaranteed action — §4.1 role-note (a)). A dishonest operator's bond is slashed when challenged; worst case under those assumptions is freeze/burn, never theft; if no honest challenger acts in-window, unchallenged fraudulent reimbursement can drain vault value (§3.6). The operator set is **open/permissionless** (§4.1.1): anyone **MAY** register and serve, including a holder as their own operator.

**Threshold / FROST is allowed only for the gatekeeper key** (when designated): a gatekeeper **MAY** be a MuSig2/FROST threshold aggregate (still a single x-only key in-circuit). Its threshold affects **approval liveness** only. A gatekeeper that performs R-04/R-08 **honestly** **cannot** create unbacked mints (backing is circuit-enforced against *some* header chain; R-04/R-08 anchor canonicity + diversity — §2.1 role table / §6.3); a **compromised / negligent** gatekeeper that **skips** R-04/R-08 **can** enable unbacked mints via **Attack A** / **Attack B**, so gatekeeper **integrity** is a **backing-safety dependency**. Threshold aggregation **does not** remove that integrity dependency — it only distributes **liveness** of approval. **Warning (MUST state):** an **N-of-N** gatekeeper aggregate means loss of a single member key **permanently disables minting** of that asset (rotation of a bound gatekeeper = new asset); threshold (t-of-n) for the **gatekeeper only** is **RECOMMENDED** to avoid permanent disablement from a single key loss.

An organisation **MAY** also operate an ordinary operator node if and only if launch gate A(1) still holds (affiliated keys strictly under half). Membership as operator confers **no** special mint or redeem privilege beyond the ordinary operator role.

### 2.2 What the gatekeeper (and any minter) cannot do

| Action | Why it fails |
|--------|----------------|
| Block transfers of circulating zkBTC | Ordinary §2 sends; no gatekeeper/minter clause in holder transitions |
| Block redemptions | Peg-out path (§4.3) has no gatekeeper step; operators serve holders |
| Forge supply without real vault backing | Mint clauses (e)/(f)/(h): LCP `MoveToBacked` confirmation + N-of-N + recursive `operator_set_root` equality + depth ≥ `D_mint`, one-shot `Pk_mint` uniqueness, `amount == vault-output amount`; in gatekeeper mode, private-fork mint further blocked by gatekeeper withholding `Pk_mint` until **canonical** confirmation (R-04) — **provided the gatekeeper performs R-04/R-08 honestly**; a compromised gatekeeper that skips them can enable Attack A/B (§6.3). |
| Redirect a mint to a different recipient | Clause (g) recipient binding from deposit taproot commitment |
| Unilaterally seize the vault | N-of-N presigned **BitVM2** graphs; no gatekeeper admin key on vault spends; operators themselves also cannot steal, under 1-of-N + ≥1 honest live challenger acting in-window (§4.1/§5) |
| Quietly re-parameterise the asset | `vault_template`, `gatekeeper`, and `operator_set_root` are bound into `asset_id`; change implies a new asset. `refund_timelock` is a bridge-epoch parameter only (§4.4), not asset identity |
| Add, remove, or rotate the gatekeeper in place | `gatekeeper` is in `asset_id`; rotation = new asset (honest statement — §3.1, §6) |
| Substitute a self-controlled vault under an honest asset | Recursive `C_lcp.operator_set_root == IssuanceTerms_v3.operator_set_root` and membership under that root close the *foreign-root* substitution attack (§3.1, §3.3(e), §3.3.1). Under open registration they do **not** alone prevent **Attack B** (self-controlled *in-set* vault under the correct policy root — §3.1.2). Closing Attack B additionally requires, in gated mode, the **R-08** operator-set-diversity vouch; in no-gatekeeper open-registration mode Attack B is **not closed** (§3.2.1.2 / §6.4) |

```

Operators are **open-registered** per deposit epoch (§4.1.1); the diagram is unchanged in structure.

### 2.4 How the halves interact

| Event | Token standard (in-circuit) | Bridge profile (off-circuit) |
|-------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| Peg-in deposit lands | — | Deposit taproot (refund leaf) → co-signed `MoveToBacked` (extinguishes refund) → **backing-only** vault output (no depositor/cooperative refund; pre-signed reimbursement graph only); denomination check |
| Mint settles | Clauses (a)–(h); `(Pk_mint, R)`; LCP proves `MoveToBacked` confirmed at depth ≥ `D_mint` + N-of-N + recursive `operator_set_root` | Observes mint; backing-only vault UTXO is the settled backing (proven in-circuit; no host-side freshness re-check) |
| Holder transfer | Ordinary §2 | None |
| Redeem settles | `redeem_commitment` (incl. `max_fee`); `(Pkᵢ, Rᵢ)` | Accepts opening; fronts payout; claim/challenge with claim-marker `(Pkᵢ, Rᵢ, payout_txid, payout_vout)` (logical first-marker — NH-02) |
| Audit | Upper-bound circulating ≤ vault UTXOs **conditional on** the reserve-safety assumptions of §5 (1-of-N + R-04 + R-08/genesis + ≥1 honest challenger); a successful **Attack A**, **Attack B**, **or** unchallenged fraudulent/duplicate reimbursement breaks it; exact needs published aggregate attestation | Public vault UTXO set + optional balance/aggregate attestations |

### 2.5 Competing tokens / market

Because `gatekeeper`, `operator_set_root`, and `H(vault_template)` are bound into `asset_id`, each (name/genesis, vault template, **operator-registration policy**, gatekeeper) combination is a **distinct asset**. `operator_set_root` commits the asset's operator-registration **policy** — **by default and for the product profile**, the **open** permissionless-registration policy of §4.1.1 (not a fixed key list); a **closed genesis-enumerated** policy P′ is a distinct non-default alternative used only in the materially-weaker no-gatekeeper Corner-B profile (§3.1.2 / §3.2.1.2). So a "different operator set" means a different **registration policy**, not (under the default) a different frozen enumeration of keys. Anyone **MAY** deploy a competing zkBTC with their own gatekeeper, a different registration policy, or no gatekeeper. Wallets **MUST** key by `asset_id` (and circuit lineage), never by display name alone. Adoption decides which zkBTC wins. The asset model supports this natively.

---

## 3. Token standard 3 — permissionless, deposit-backed, redeemable (`issuance_version == 3`)

Token standard 3 is a new issuance schema in the sense of specification.md §6.5. It is **not** an edit to frozen v1; it ships only as a version branch of the **v2 circuit surface**. Dispatch **MUST** be an in-circuit version branch of the same circuit `C` (specification.md §6.5 "Adding new token standards"): a separate per-version circuit would break cyclic recursion when an account lineage mixes standards.

### 3.1 IssuanceTerms_v3 schema

Denominations and `refund_timelock` are **not** part of the token terms. Values bound into `asset_id` freeze for the life of the asset; denomination economics and deposit-taproot CSV depend on BitVM2 mainnet cost reality and **MUST** remain adjustable per deposit epoch as bridge parameters (§4.4). Soundness needs `vault_template` and `operator_set_root` in the terms (cross-asset double-backing closure and vault-legitimacy binding) plus in-circuit `amount == vault-output amount` and operator-set membership.

```
IssuanceTerms_v3 = {
  asset_id          : field,     // = Hc("AssetIdV3", genesis_tag ‖ gatekeeper ‖ operator_set_root
                                 //      ‖ H(name) ‖ decimals ‖ issuance_version ‖ H(vault_template))
                                 //   genesis_tag reuses the v1 constant ASCII string "zkCoins/v1/genesis" (§3.7.2)
  gatekeeper        : 32 bytes,  // x-only BIP-340 pubkey of the optional quality authority;
                                 //   OR the all-zero 32-byte sentinel = "no gatekeeper"

}
```

**Transport.** Identical to specification.md §6.5 IssuanceTerms transport: terms travel as optional `asset_terms` inside `CoinProof` (or out-of-band). The receiver recomputes `asset_id` and rejects a mismatch. The human-readable `name` is never on-chain.

#### 3.1.1 `vault_template` canonical encoding and `instantiate` (normative — B-02)

`vault_template` is a **canonical byte template** for the vault's **script-path tapleaf set**. Parameter holes are filled only by `instantiate`:

| Hole | Width | Meaning |
|------|-------|---------|
| `AGG_KEY_HOLE` | 32 bytes | **N-of-N** (BitVM2) aggregate x-only public key **identity** of the vault instance — used to bind the instance to an `agg_key` admitted by `operator_set_root` and to label the pre-signed graph for this operator set. **MUST NOT** create a live `agg_key` CHECKSIG spend path (NEW-01). The vault presigning set is **N-of-N**, not a threshold (NEW-01 — §2.1). |
| `EPOCH_HOLE` | 8 bytes | Deposit-epoch identifier (`u64` big-endian); binds the instance to a bridge epoch |
| `CSV_OP_HOLE` | variable (BIP-68 encoded) | Operator / reimbursement / claim-connector-leaf CSV relative locktime; filled to the **BitVM2 assert/challenge/disprove CSV windows** of this epoch (B-06 / §4.4 — not a mint-window formula) |

There is **no** `CSV_REFUND_HOLE`, **no** depositor-refund leaf, and **no** cooperative-refund leaf on the **backing-only** vault output (R-01). The depositor's unilateral refund lives exclusively on the **deposit taproot** (§4.2) and is extinguished when `MoveToBacked` consumes that output.

All other script structure is fixed by the template. The template **MUST NOT** contain `asset_id` as a free field outside the asset/epoch binding leaf (that would be circular: `asset_id` depends on `H(vault_template)`).

**NUMS internal key (MUST — no key-path spend).** The vault taproot output **MUST** use an **unspendable NUMS internal key** — a point with no known discrete log — so there is **no key-path spend**. Using `agg_key` as the internal key is **forbidden**: a key-path spend by the operator set would bypass every CSV-locked leaf and every pre-signed reimbursement path.

**NUMS derivation (normative — NEW-03).** The internal key **MUST** be an unspendable nothing-up-my-sleeve point with no known discrete log, identical for every vault of every asset (**not** a secret and **not** asset-bound). Derivation rule:

1. Domain tag: the fixed ASCII string `zkCoins/v2/VaultNUMS`.
2. Let `domain_sep` be the consensus-fixed 32-byte all-zero string of the v2 release.
3. `NUMS_xonly := xonly(hash_to_curve(domain_tag ‖ domain_sep))`, where `hash_to_curve` is a consensus-pinned hash-to-curve into secp256k1 with unknown discrete log (BIP-340-compatible even-y lift).  
   **Rationale / relation to BIP-341:** this is the same class of construction as the BIP-341 example NUMS internal key `H` (lift of the SHA-256 midstate of the BIP-341 tagged hash of the curve generator); this profile pins a profile-specific domain tag so the point is unambiguous for zkCoins vaults.
4. The concrete 32-byte x-only NUMS value is a **launch pin** of the v2 release (one value, frozen with the circuit digests). Until that pin, the derivation rule above is normative; the byte value is marked `PROVISIONAL`.

**No live CHECKSIG on the vault (MUST — NEW-01; covenant-emulation core).** Every vault spend path **MUST** move funds **only along the pre-signed BitVM2 transaction graph** fixed at setup. The vault **presigning set MUST be N-of-N** (all sign; all delete — §2.1). After the per-deposit graph is fully signed, each signer's signing shares for those graph transactions **MUST** be **deleted**. Under 1-of-N setup honesty, one honest deletion means no coalition can authorise a spend outside the approved graph.

- There is **no live signing path** on the vault output: a live threshold/`agg_key` CHECKSIG that any current coalition could use to sign an **arbitrary** vault spend is **forbidden**. The presigning set itself is N-of-N, not t-of-n (NEW-01).
- Operator / reimbursement / connector leaves **MUST** commit to **specific pre-signed graph transactions** (assert, challenge, disprove, payout connectors, reimbursement payout) — not to a free-form `agg_key` CHECKSIG. **No** cooperative-refund leaf on the backing-only vault (R-01 residual — §4.2).
- Each such spend is authorised only by signatures produced **once at setup** with keys then deleted. A live CHECKSIG by the current key-holders is **forbidden**.
- This restores 1-of-N safety and makes the fraud statement / sequencing connectors the **only** paths that can move vault value after `MoveToBacked`.

**Canonical ordered tapleaf set and tree construction (MUST — NEW-03).** All spend paths are **tapleaves** (script path only; BIP-341 tapleaf version `0xc0` unless a later consensus parameter freezes another version). Sorting sibling hashes alone does **not** define the tree shape; this profile pins both **leaf order** and **tree shape**:

1. **Leaf multiset (semantic identities).** `instantiate` builds exactly the following ordered multiset (fixed semantic order key = the labels below, left-to-right):

| Order key | Semantic leaf | Encoding / role |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| (a) | **Operator / reimbursement leaf** | Pre-signed-graph reimbursement entry: commits to the BitVM2 assert/reimbursement graph transaction(s) for this epoch (connector structure the graph requires). **CSV-timelocked to the BitVM2 assert/challenge/disprove window** of this epoch (B-06 / §4.4). **MUST NOT** be a live `agg_key` CHECKSIG. The filled `AGG_KEY_HOLE` identifies the operator-set aggregate bound into the graph; it does **not** authorise free-form spends. |
| (b) | **Claim / reimbursement / sequencing connector leaves** | The additional connector leaves the BitVM2 graph requires for assert/challenge/disprove serialisation and sequencing (exact scripts are graph-compiler artefacts — see launch-pin note below). Each leaf that can move vault value **MUST** be CSV-locked to the BitVM2 assert/challenge/disprove windows (B-06). |
| (c) | **Asset/epoch binding leaf** | An unspendable commit leaf (OP_RETURN-style / always-fail script path) whose data payload is exactly `asset_id_bytes (32) ‖ u64be(epoch) (8)`. |

   **No depositor refund leaf and no cooperative refund leaf** appear on the backing-only vault (R-01). Unilateral depositor reclaim exists only on the deposit taproot **before** `MoveToBacked` (§4.2).

2. **Fixed leaf ordering key.** Leaves are ordered first by the semantic order key `(a) < (b) < (c)`; within (b), by ascending `tapleaf_hash` of each connector leaf (deterministic secondary key). This produces a total order independent of insertion order.

3. **Tree-shape rule (canonical balanced binary combination).** Over the ordered leaf list `L[0..n-1]`, build a **left-complete balanced binary Merkle tree** as follows:
   - If `n = 1`, the Merkle root is that single `tapleaf_hash`.
   - Otherwise, pair consecutive leaves left-to-right into parent nodes; BIP-341 sibling lexicographic sort applies **only within each pair** (standard BIP-341: `parent = H_tapbranch(min(a,b) ‖ max(a,b))`).
   - If the current level has an odd count, the last unpaired hash is promoted unchanged to the next level (left-complete; no Huffman rebalancing, no free reordering of unpaired nodes).
   - Repeat until one root remains.
   This rule, together with the fixed leaf order and NUMS internal key, fully determines the tree bytes for a **fixed** leaf multiset.

4. **Launch-pin honesty for concrete connector bytes (`PROVISIONAL`).** The **semantic** construction (leaf roles, CSV bounds, no live CHECKSIG, no vault refund leaf, NUMS, order key, tree-shape rule) is normative now. The **concrete** connector-leaf script bytes emitted by the BitVM2 graph compiler are launch parameters: until the compiler template is frozen with the v2 circuit digests, byte-equality of `instantiate(…)` is defined **relative to the pinned template** once fixed, not claimed as fully determined by the prose alone. Implementations **MUST NOT** claim present-day absolute byte-determinism for the connector subset beyond the semantic pins above.

Define the concrete vault output by instantiation:

```
instantiate(vault_template, asset_id, agg_key, epoch) :=
  // 1. Fill holes deterministically:
  leaves := vault_template tapleaf set with
              AGG_KEY_HOLE     ← agg_key                    // 32-byte x-only identity (NOT live CHECKSIG)
              EPOCH_HOLE       ← u64be(epoch)               // 8-byte big-endian
              CSV_OP_HOLE      ← bip68_csv(assert_challenge_csv)  // BitVM2 assert/challenge/disprove window (B-06)
              asset/epoch leaf payload ← asset_id_bytes ‖ u64be(epoch)
              // NO CSV_REFUND_HOLE; NO depositor-refund leaf; NO cooperative-refund leaf
  // 2. Internal key := NUMS   // unspendable; NO key-path spend (MUST)
  // 3. Order leaves by semantic key (a)<(b)<(c), then within (b) by
  //    ascending tapleaf_hash; build left-complete balanced BIP-341 tree
  //    (tree-shape rule above).
  // 4. output_key := BIP341_tweak(NUMS, merkle_root(leaves))
  // 5. scriptPubKey := P2TR(output_key)   // 34-byte witness program
  // Return the exact scriptPubKey bytes (and, for LCP equality, the full
  // serialised output script as used on Bitcoin) relative to the pinned
  // vault_template / graph-compiler template at launch.
```

Normative properties:

- Instantiation is a pure function of `(vault_template, asset_id, agg_key, epoch)` together with the consensus NUMS point and the epoch's BitVM2 assert/challenge/disprove CSV constants (B-06 / §4.4). Two different `asset_id` values **MUST** produce different scriptPubKeys (via the asset/epoch binding leaf). `refund_timelock` is **not** an input to vault instantiation (it belongs only to the deposit taproot — §4.2 / §4.4). There is **no** mint-freshness window `W` and **no** `D_mint + S + W + 1` CSV term.
- At mint time, clause (e) **MUST** verify that the proven vault output's scriptPubKey is **byte-equal** to `instantiate(vault_template, this asset_id, agg_key, epoch)` for some `agg_key` admitted by `operator_set_root` and the epoch committed in the deposit path. Byte-equality is executable once the launch-pinned template (including connector-leaf bytes) and NUMS value are frozen; until then equality is relative to that pin (NEW-03 honesty).
- **Consequence (B-01 restored via MoveToBacked):** there is **no key-path bypass** and **no live free-form CHECKSIG**; the backing-only vault is spendable **only** via the BitVM2 assert/challenge/disprove pre-signed-graph leaves. One BTC outpoint can back at most one asset. A minter **cannot** omit the asset binding: an output that does not match the required instance fails the mint. Settled mint ↔ backing-only UTXO is proven **in-circuit** by confirming `MoveToBacked` (§3.3(e)); no host-side freshness re-check.
- **Consequence (R-01 / INV-01):** a depositor **cannot** mint against a vaulted output and later unilaterally refund the same BTC: the backing-only vault carries no depositor-refund leaf and no cooperative-refund leaf; unilateral reclaim exists only if `MoveToBacked` never happens (deposit-taproot refund). If `MoveToBacked` fires but the mint never settles, the vaulted BTC is an **irrevocable, consented contribution to the shared reserve** (cross-graph reimbursement may consume it for another holder's redeem — §3.4, §4.2), not merely frozen recoverable BTC.

#### 3.1.2 Operator-set legitimacy (normative — Part 2)

`operator_set_root` is a 32-byte commitment to this asset's **operator-registration policy** P (encoding of the policy tree is a launch parameter; the root value is frozen in `asset_id`). **Default and recommended** policy P is **open and permissionless**: anyone **MAY** join an epoch by posting the policy's bond and a pubkey with proof-of-possession (§4.1.2); there is **no allowlist and no admin approval**. Under that default it is a **policy** root, **not** a frozen enumeration of operator keys — the concrete per-epoch operator set is open and rotates (§4.1.1). **Alternative (non-default):** a *closed genesis-enumerated* policy P′ (fixed key list + gate-A(1) diversity at launch) is a **distinct policy P** (distinct `operator_set_root` / `asset_id`) usable only in the **materially weaker** no-gatekeeper + closed-set profile of the trilemma (§3.2.1.2 / §6.4) — it closes Attack B by enumeration but does **not** cleanly close Attack A and **abandons open registration**; it is **not** a trust-minimized peer of gatekeeper-gated open registration. Concrete registration-window length, epoch cadence, exact bond amount within the bond class, and setup-window deadline are **per-epoch bridge parameters** (§4.4) and do **not** change `asset_id`.

**Two-level admission (MUST):**

1. Each deposit epoch E publishes an on-chain **epoch registration commitment** `reg_root_E` = commitment to the set of operators that validly registered for E under policy P (each posted the required bond with PoP — formation and checks in §4.1.2). The epoch's N-of-N aggregate key `agg_key_E` is the MuSig2 KeyAgg of exactly that registered set (§4.1.2).
2. The mint (clause (e)) **MUST** verify, via the recursive LCP, that `agg_key` (used in `instantiate`) is admitted by a chain of commitments rooted at the **asset-bound** policy root: `agg_key` is the aggregate of the epoch's registered set whose `reg_root_E` was validly formed under P, and the outer circuit checks `C_lcp.operator_set_root == IssuanceTerms_v3.operator_set_root` (policy-root equality — §3.3.1). A bare `operator_set_member_ok` boolean remains **INSUFFICIENT**.

**Two distinct drain attacks (normative).**

- **Attack A — private-fork amortization.** Attacker mines a private fork, fires `MoveToBacked` only there, mints from the private-fork LCP, refunds the deposit on the canonical chain → unbacked. **Closed by R-04** (gatekeeper canonical-chain anchor: withholds `Pk_mint` until `MoveToBacked` **and** `reg_root_E` are confirmed on the gatekeeper's **own canonical Bitcoin view** — §3.2.1.1 / §3.3.2 / §3.4 / §4.1.2).
- **Attack B — self-controlled in-set vault → cross-graph drain (R-08).** Under **open permissionless registration**, an attacker registers a **Sybil epoch it fully controls** (all N keys its own — the open policy admits anyone), makes a **real, canonical** deposit + mint (so it passes R-04 and clause (e)), and — because it controlled all N at setup, with **no honest signer to refuse** — pre-signs a **malicious graph** that pays the vault back to itself. It drains its own vault, leaving the minted zkBTC unbacked, then redeems that **fungible** zkBTC **cross-graph against honest vaults** (§4.3). Net: honest holders' backing is drained. **R-04 does NOT close Attack B** — every transaction is canonical. **Attack B is closed ONLY by the gatekeeper's per-mint operator-set-diversity vouch (R-08):** in gated mode the gatekeeper **MUST** refuse to sign the mint unless the backing epoch's operator set has **at least one independent honest signer (1-of-N-honest basis)** that will refuse a malicious graph. R-08 **extends** the existing §3.2.1.1 "Approval semantics" point 2 legitimacy vouch ("real 1-of-N-honest registered set — not an attacker-controlled N-of-N") with explicit methodology: the gatekeeper vets registrant **identity / reputation** off-protocol (the circuit cannot — a pubkey market cannot distinguish one party's N keys from N parties). R-08 is an **entry-time / mint-time** duty; it does **not** touch exit (REQ-4 intact) and does **not** gatekeep who may register or serve exits — only whether a *mint* settles against a given backing vault.

**Why this still closes the drain (load-bearing).** Without policy-root binding, an attacker could register itself as the entire N-of-N of a self-controlled epoch under a *foreign* root, deposit, mint, then cooperatively spend its own vault → unbacked-but-fungible zkBTC redeemed cross-graph against honest vaults (1-of-N honesty vacuous when the attacker supplies all N). Recursive `operator_set_root` equality closes that **foreign-root** substitution. Separately, the **open registration policy** does **not** by itself prevent an attacker from registering a solo self-controlled epoch *under the correct policy root* (**Attack B**). Therefore:

1. Policy P **MUST** encode the launch-gate-A(1)-class economic anti-Sybil / anti-domination constraint (§4.6A): the admissibility predicate **MUST** require that no single party controls ≥ half of an epoch's registered operator set (enforced economically by bond cost + the honest-registration assumption). This is a **weaker, both-modes** defense and is **insufficient alone** against Attack B under pooled cross-graph reimbursement.
2. In **gatekeeper mode**, Attack B is closed by the **R-08** operator-set-diversity vouch (not by R-04). R-04 remains the Attack-A private-fork / canonical-anchor defense for **both** `MoveToBacked` **and** `reg_root_E`.
3. In **no-gatekeeper + open registration + pooled cross-graph** mode (**Corner C** of the sound-deployment trilemma), neither R-04 nor R-08 applies; the economic bond alone is insufficient and the combination is **UNSOUND** for trust-minimized pooled backing (§3.2.1.2 / §5 residual 9 / §6.4).
4. In **no-gatekeeper + closed genesis-enumerated set + pooled** mode (**Corner B**), Attack B is closed by genesis enumeration under launch gate A(1), but **Attack A is still only mitigated by operators-as-best-effort-oracle** (no external canonical anchor) — **materially weaker, not clean** (§3.2.1.2 / §6.4). Closing the operator set does **not** close Attack A.

**Honest cost of an open operator set:** open permissionless registration shifts the anti-self-controlled-vault (Attack B) defense from a genesis enumeration to (a) the gatekeeper's **R-08** operator-set-diversity vouch at mint (gated mode; 1-of-N-honest basis) and (b) an economic anti-domination bond/stake property of policy P (both modes, weaker, insufficient alone). Attack A remains closed **cleanly only** by R-04 (gated mode; covers `MoveToBacked` and `reg_root_E`) — independent of whether the operator set is open or closed. This **MUST** be stated, not hidden.

Changing policy P produces a different `operator_set_root` and therefore a **different** `asset_id` (new asset).

#### 3.1.3 Binding rules

- `decimals` **MUST** equal `8` for the zkBTC asset (satoshi base units).
- `vault_template` is bound into `asset_id` via `H(vault_template)`. Changing the template produces a **different** `asset_id` (new asset).
- `gatekeeper` is bound into `asset_id` and `terms_hash`. Presence and identity are fixed and holder-visible. A gatekeeper **cannot** be added, removed, or rotated without producing a different asset (**rotation = new asset** — stated honestly).
- `operator_set_root` is bound into `asset_id` and `terms_hash` (same freeze discipline — changing the *policy* = new asset). Policy identity (join rule, bond class/tier, anti-domination predicate, KeyAgg+PoP rule, R-08 duty for gated deployments) is identity-bound; concrete registration-window length, epoch cadence, exact bond amount within class, and setup-window deadline are **not** identity-bound (§4.4).
- `refund_timelock` is a **per-deposit-epoch bridge parameter** only (§4.4). It governs the deposit-taproot refund leaf, not token identity, and is **not** in `IssuanceTerms_v3`, `AssetIdV3`, or `terms_hash`.
- Allowed deposit/payout denominations are **per-deposit-epoch bridge parameters** (§4.4). The circuit enforces only `amount == vault-output amount`, not membership of a frozen denomination set.

### 3.2 Mint key derivation and the one-shot mint account

#### 3.2.1 Additive-tweak mint key (`Pk_mint`)

The mint anchors to the **`MoveToBacked` vault outpoint** `(vault_txid, vault_vout)` — the backing-only N-of-N/BitVM2 vault UTXO created when `MoveToBacked` consumes the user's deposit output — **not** the user's original deposit outpoint. Write `vault_outpoint := vault_txid ‖ vault_vout` (32-byte txid ‖ 4-byte little-endian `vout`, matching Bitcoin outpoint serialisation).

For each such vault outpoint of this `asset_id`:

```
digest = Hc("zkCoins/v2/MintKey", asset_id ‖ vault_outpoint)
```

**Digest-to-scalar (normative, mirrors specification.md §3.2 BIP-340/S2C).** Let `n` be the secp256k1 group order.

1. Let `h_bytes` be the **32-byte serialization** of the Poseidon `Hc` digest (byte order per parent specification.md §1.7).
2. Interpret `h_bytes` as a **big-endian integer** and reduce **mod `n`** to obtain the scalar candidate `h`.
3. If the reduced value is `0`, **redraw** with a defined domain-tagged counter: recompute  
   `digest = Hc("zkCoins/v2/MintKey", asset_id ‖ vault_outpoint ‖ u32-be(counter))`  
   with `counter` starting at `1` and incremented until `h ≠ 0` (analogous to the parent redraw rule for exceptional S2C nonces). The unbiased reduction bias is ≈ `2⁻¹²⁸`, negligible.
4. **Even-y base normalisation (MUST — M-01).** Let `Pk_base` be the mode-dependent base key (§3.2.1.1 / §3.2.1.2). Before the additive tweak, `Pk_base` **MUST** be normalised to the **even-y lift** of its x-only encoding (parent specification.md §1.157):
   - Lift the 32-byte x-only encoding to the unique even-y curve point `P_base`.
   - Let `sk_base` be the corresponding secret for that even-y point (if the holder's raw secret produces the odd-y point, set `sk_base := n − sk_raw mod n` so that `sk_base · G = P_base` with even y).
   - All subsequent arithmetic uses this even-y `(P_base, sk_base)` pair.
5. Form the unnormalised point `P = P_base + h · G` on secp256k1.
6. If `P` is the point at infinity, **reject** and redraw with the next counter (same domain tag).
7. **BIP-340 x-only (even-y) normalisation of the result:**
   - if `y(P)` is odd: set `Pk_mint` to the even-y negation (`−P`) and  
     `sk_mint = n − (sk_base + h) mod n`;
   - else: set `Pk_mint = P` (x-only) and  
     `sk_mint = (sk_base + h) mod n`.

A pure hash-to-point construction (`Pk_mint = H_to_point(…)`) would be a NUMS point with no known discrete log — unusable as an account spend key. The additive-tweak form is deliberate: it keeps mint authority on the mode-dependent base secret while making each vault outpoint's key unique and outpoint-bound.

##### 3.2.1.1 Gatekeeper-gated mode (`gatekeeper ≠ 0³²`)

```
Pk_mint = BIP340_even_y( gatekeeper_pubkey_even_y + h · G )
sk_mint = sk_gk_even_y + h   (with parity/negation per step 7)
```

where `gatekeeper_pubkey` is the x-only key from `IssuanceTerms_v3.gatekeeper` (fixed in `asset_id`) and `h` derives from `vault_outpoint` as above. Only the gatekeeper knows `sk_mint = sk_gk + h` (after even-y normalisation).

Because the accumulator admits `(Pk_mint, R)` only under a BIP-340 signature over `m_state` by `Pk_mint` (parent specification.md §3.2), **producing that on-chain nullifier IS the gatekeeper's act of approval** ("I permit this mint") — zero extra circuit cost beyond the ordinary spent-key check. First-occurrence on the deterministic `Pk_mint` (fixed `gatekeeper_pubkey` from `asset_id`, `h` from `vault_outpoint`) makes **one mint per deposit**, even against a malicious gatekeeper.

**Approval semantics (normative).** The gatekeeper's signature over `m_state` vouches that, for this mint:

1. **Source-of-funds:** the public on-chain BTC feeding the deposit has passed the gatekeeper's screening (reject hack/tainted/sanctioned BTC at entry);
2. **Vault/operator-set legitimacy + diversity (MUST — R-08):** the vault instance is legitimately constituted under this asset's `operator_set_root` policy as a **real 1-of-N-honest registered set — not an attacker-controlled N-of-N**. The gatekeeper **MUST** refuse to sign unless the backing epoch's operator set has **at least one independent honest signer (1-of-N-honest basis)** that will refuse a malicious graph. Methodology is **off-protocol identity / reputation** vetting of registrants (the circuit cannot distinguish one party's N keys from N parties — a pure pubkey market is insufficient). This is the **R-08 operator-set-diversity vouch** that closes **Attack B** (self-controlled Sybil-epoch → cross-graph drain — §3.1.2). R-08 is mint/entry-time only; it does **not** gatekeep registration or exit (REQ-4 intact);
3. **Committed recipient and clean deposit-backing:** the mint's **witness / inputs** establish a real LCP-proven vault deposit (≥ depth, to the asset's instantiated vault), the committed recipient (clause (g)), and operator-set membership under the asset-bound root (clause (e));
4. **Canonical-chain anchor (MUST — closes R-04 / Attack A; covers `MoveToBacked` and `reg_root_E`).** On the gatekeeper's **own canonical Bitcoin view**: (i) the relevant `MoveToBacked` is confirmed to depth ≥ `D_mint` on the **canonical** chain, (ii) the deposit output was **not** refunded on the canonical chain, and (iii) the epoch's `reg_root_E` backing this mint is the **canonical** registration commitment (not a private-fork / substituted root) and commits the registered set the gatekeeper vetted for diversity (R-08). The gatekeeper **MUST withhold** the `Pk_mint` signature until all hold. Because the mint cannot settle without the gatekeeper's `Pk_mint` signature (`sk_mint = sk_gk + h`; only the gatekeeper can produce it), a private-fork `MoveToBacked` or a substituted `reg_root_E` yields **no mint**. A co-signed `MoveToBacked` alone is **insufficient** as the sole canonicity gate — its N-of-N setup signature is valid on any fork; the gate is the gatekeeper withholding the **final** mint signature until canonical confirmation of both anchors. The gatekeeper is therefore the **canonical-chain anchor** for **both** `MoveToBacked` **and** `reg_root_E`, not only a source-of-funds / legitimacy check. R-04 closes **Attack A** only; it does **not** close Attack B.

**Signing order / mint-signing checklist (normative — GK-2 + R-03 / R-04 / R-08; MUST).** "Verify the full mint proof before signing" is **circular**: the completed proof `C` embeds the gatekeeper's BIP-340 signature over `m_state` (S2C over `H(ProofData)`), so the proof cannot exist before the signature. The correct order is:

1. The gatekeeper verifies the mint's witness/inputs — the LCP-proven vault deposit (real, ≥ depth, to the asset's `instantiate`d vault), the committed recipient, `operator_set_root` membership against the asset-bound root, its own source-of-funds / legitimacy policy, and the **R-08** operator-set-diversity / 1-of-N-honest check for the backing epoch — **NOT** a completed proof.
2. **Canonical confirmation (MUST — R-04 / Attack A):** on the gatekeeper's **own canonical Bitcoin view**, confirm that (i) `MoveToBacked` is present at depth ≥ `D_mint` on the **canonical** chain, (ii) the deposit output was **not** refunded on the canonical chain, and (iii) `reg_root_E` is the canonical registration commitment for the epoch (same R-04 duty as `MoveToBacked` — §4.1.2). **Withhold** the mint signature until all hold.
3. **Operator-set diversity (MUST — R-08 / Attack B):** confirm that the backing epoch's registered operator set has **at least one independent honest signer (1-of-N-honest basis)** under the gatekeeper's off-protocol identity/reputation methodology. **Withhold** the mint signature if the set is (or is reasonably assessed to be) a self-controlled Sybil epoch.
4. Only then does the gatekeeper produce the transition-authorization **signature** (`sk_mint` S2C over `m_state` committing `H(ProofData)`).
5. After that signature exists, the final proof `C` is constructed embedding it and settled.

**Caveat (MUST state).** Blind signing (signing without checking inputs, including without the canonical-chain check on `MoveToBacked`/`reg_root_E` or the R-08 diversity vouch) cannot create an unbacked mint that the circuit alone rejects (backing is circuit-enforced against *some* header chain) — but it **does** re-open the private-fork amortization attack of R-04 (Attack A) and the self-controlled Sybil-epoch drain of R-08 (Attack B), and may waste the `Pk_mint` slot or wave through a tainted mint. The gatekeeper checks all proof inputs, its own canonical Bitcoin view (both anchors), **and** operator-set diversity, signs only after all hold, then the proof is built (R-03).

##### 3.2.1.2 No-gatekeeper mode (`gatekeeper = 0³²`)

```
Pk_mint = BIP340_even_y( depositor_base_even_y + h · G )
```

where `depositor_base` is a key the depositor **commits in the deposit taproot** and the mint verifies in-circuit via the LCP leaf data (exactly like the recipient commitment of clause (g)). **WITHOUT** this in-circuit commitment, any prover could choose its own base and first-occurrence would give no one-mint-per-outpoint guarantee — so this commitment is **MANDATORY** in no-gatekeeper mode.

**Hard limitation (MUST state — R-04 + R-08 / §6.4 / §3.1.2).** With `Pk_mint` anchored on the depositor's own key, the depositor produces the mint signature itself. There is therefore **no external canonical observer** and **no operator-set-diversity vouch** under open registration:

- **Attack A (private-fork amortization)** is **not cleanly closed**: mine a private fork, fire co-signed `MoveToBacked` only there, mint from the private-fork LCP proof, refund the deposit on the canonical chain → unbacked zkBTC amortized over many deposits (R-04 absent). Without a gatekeeper, Attack A is mitigated only if operators refuse to reimburse against non-canonical vaults — a **best-effort operator-honesty / oracle** assumption (**materially weaker, not clean**). **Closing the operator set does NOT close Attack A** — a closed set has no external canonical observer either.
- **Attack B (self-controlled Sybil epoch → cross-graph drain)** is **not closed under open registration**: an attacker can register a fully self-controlled epoch, mint canonically against it, pre-sign a malicious graph that pays the vault back to itself, and redeem the fungible unbacked zkBTC against honest vaults (R-08 absent — §3.1.2). The economic anti-domination bond of policy P alone is **insufficient**. Attack B **is** closed by an **operator set with at least one independent honest signer (1-of-N-honest basis)**: either the gatekeeper's **R-08** diversity vouch (works for an **open** set) **or** a closed genesis-enumerated set under launch gate A(1).

**Two independent drain attacks (backbone — MUST).** A pooled cross-graph reserve requires **both** drain attacks be closed. They are **independent** and closed by **different** mechanisms:

- **Attack A (private-fork amortization):** closed **cleanly only** by an external canonical observer at mint = the gatekeeper's **R-04** canonical anchor (covering `MoveToBacked` **and** `reg_root_E`). Without a gatekeeper, Attack A is only operator-oracle-weak (**materially weaker, not clean**). **Independent of whether the operator set is open or closed.**
- **Attack B (self-controlled Sybil vault):** closed by an **operator set with at least one independent honest signer (1-of-N-honest basis)**: either the gatekeeper's **R-08** diversity vouch (open set) **or** genesis enumeration under launch gate A(1) (closed set). Under **open registration without a gatekeeper**, there is **no 1-of-N-honest guarantee** → Attack B open → **UNSOUND**.

**Sound-deployment trilemma (MUST — normative; no fully-clean no-gatekeeper pooled profile).** A trust-minimized pooled cross-graph zkBTC needs both attacks closed cleanly. The three profiles:

| Corner | Properties | Verdict | Notes |
|--------|------------|---------|-------|
| **A (RECOMMENDED — this is zkBTC)** | Open registration + pooled + a gatekeeper (gives up no-gatekeeper) | **Sound / clean** | Both attacks cleanly closed: R-04 closes Attack A (covers `MoveToBacked` **and** `reg_root_E` — §4.1.2); R-08 closes Attack B. Primary product profile. |
| **B** | No gatekeeper + pooled + a **closed, genesis-enumerated, gate-A(1)** operator set (gives up open registration) | **Materially weaker (Attack A operator-oracle-only), not clean; abandons open registration; distinct closed-enumeration policy** | Attack B closed by genesis enumeration (gate A(1)), but **Attack A is still only mitigated by operators-as-best-effort-oracle** (no canonical anchor). Closing the set does **not** close Attack A. Requires `operator_set_root` to commit a *closed enumeration* policy P′ (distinct from the open default of §4.1.1 — a different asset). **NOT** a trust-minimized peer of Corner A. |
| **C (FORBIDDEN)** | Open registration + no gatekeeper + pooled simultaneously | **UNSOUND** | Attack B open (no 1-of-N-honest guarantee); Attack A only operator-oracle-weak. No constructible in-protocol defense (`redeem_commitment` has no epoch/provenance field; binding a vault outpoint is not constructible — §3.5.5). **MUST NOT** be deployed or marketed as trust-minimized. |

**Bottom line (MUST state):** there is **no fully-clean no-gatekeeper profile for a pooled cross-graph reserve** — a **trust-minimized pooled cross-graph zkBTC REQUIRES a gatekeeper (or an equivalent external canonical+diversity oracle)** for **both** Attack A (R-04) and Attack B (R-08). No-gatekeeper + open = **UNSOUND**; no-gatekeeper + closed = **materially weaker** and not the open product. The product requirement (open operators + pooled fungible) **forces Corner A**. Cross-refs: §5 residual 9, §6.4, §6.6.

```
depositor_base_commitment = H("zkCoins/v2/DepositorBase", depositor_base ‖ db_blind)
```

carried as committed leaf data in the deposit taproot beside the recipient commitment and refund leaf. Clause (b) opens it and checks `Pk_mint` derivation against the opened `depositor_base` (even-y normalised per M-01).

#### 3.2.2 One-shot mint account (consumed-key uniqueness)

Every vaulted deposit spawns a fresh **one-shot mint account** whose genesis key is `Pk₀ = Pk_mint`. The TS3 mint **MUST** be that account's genesis transition:

- `prev_account_state.send_counter == 0`
- `prev_account_state.current_pubkey == Pk_mint`

The mint consumes `Pk_mint` and publishes `(Pk_mint, R)` as its on-chain nullifier. First-occurrence on `Pk_mint` (specification.md §3.6 / §3.7) makes a second settled mint against the same vault outpoint impossible — the exact token-standard-2 genesis mechanism (specification.md §6.5 clause (f)) reused **per vault outpoint**.

**Naked-aux-key gap (normative rationale).** A design that merely "additionally publishes" an auxiliary key without consuming it would **not** be checked by any compliance-predicate clause. A second mint could still settle under a different consumed key. That is why the mint key **MUST BE** the consumed key of the mint transition, not a naked auxiliary object.

**Front-running.**

- **Gatekeeper-gated:** a third party **cannot** burn the `Pk_mint` slot: accumulator admission requires a BIP-340 signature over `m_state` by `Pk_mint`, and only the gatekeeper knows `sk_mint`.
- **No-gatekeeper:** only the holder of `depositor_base` knows `sk_mint`; the in-circuit commitment of `depositor_base` prevents a stranger from choosing a different base for the same outpoint.

### 3.3 Mint clauses (normative, in-circuit)

When `asset_issuance` is present and `issuance_version == 3`, the **v2 circuit surface** of `C` **MUST** verify all of the following (style parallel to specification.md §6.5 (a)–(g)). Clause numbering (a)–(h) is local to this standard; it hooks into specification.md §2.1 clause 3 the same way standards 1 and 2 do.

- **(a)** `issuance_version == 3` — this branch accepts only TS3 mints.
- **(b) Base + vault-outpoint binding.** The mint account's `owner` equals `H(Pk_mint ‖ nk_commit)`. The circuit verifies in-circuit the full §3.2.1 derivation:

  ```
  Pk_mint == BIP340_even_y( Pk_base + h · G )
  ```

  where `h` is the mod-`n` reduction of `Hc("zkCoins/v2/MintKey", asset_id ‖ vault_outpoint)` (with the §3.2.1 redraw/counter rules and even-y base normalisation), and `Pk_base` is:

  - **Gatekeeper-gated:** the even-y lift of `gatekeeper` from `asset_id`;
  - **No-gatekeeper:** the even-y lift of `depositor_base` opened from the deposit-taproot commitment (LCP leaf data).

  This simultaneously binds the mint to the **mode base** and to the **vault outpoint**.
- **(c)** `asset_id` recomputation per §3.1 (`AssetIdV3` preimage including `gatekeeper`, `operator_set_root`, `H(vault_template)`; no `refund_timelock`).
- **(d)** `terms_hash` recomputation per §3.1 (`gatekeeper`, `operator_set_root`, `H(vault_template)`).
- **(e) Vault-backing reality (LCP sub-proof).** Recursively verify a Bitcoin light-client sub-proof — normatively a **separate recursive Plonky2 circuit** whose root is verified inside `C` (the BRIDGE_MVP.md §3.2 recursive-LCP decision remains valid; inlining SHA-256d header chains into the main compliance budget is not required). The LCP statement **MUST** establish all of:
  1. **Header chain.** A chain of Bitcoin headers from a **pinned checkpoint** (checkpoint value is a circuit / S2C consensus parameter of the v2 release — §3.7.2, §11); each header is PoW-valid and links to its predecessor; cumulative work is computed.
  2. **`MoveToBacked` vault outpoint (not the user's deposit outpoint).** The proven UTXO is the **backing-only vault output** `(vault_txid, vault_vout)` created by a confirmed **`MoveToBacked`** transaction — the N-of-N/BitVM2 vault UTXO that consumes the user's deposit output. `Pk_mint` derivation uses this same vault outpoint (§3.2.1).
  3. **N-of-N witness proof (MUST — closes the drain-class private-fork hole).** The LCP **MUST** prove that the `MoveToBacked` transaction spent the user's deposit output through the **vault leaf under the N-of-N (BitVM2 aggregate) signature** produced at setup — i.e. the spend is authenticated by the operator set's pre-signed graph path, not by the user's refund leaf.  
     **Rationale:** without this, an attacker could, in a private fork, spend their own deposit via the refund leaf into a look-alike `vault_descriptor` output and fabricate unlimited unbacked "MoveToBacked"s with no operator, amortising one discarded fork over unlimited fake mints. Requiring the N-of-N witness makes forging a `MoveToBacked` require full operator collusion, which the 1-of-N setup-honesty assumption excludes.
  4. **Vault script instance byte-equality + operator-set membership (MUST — B-02 + Part 2; two-level admission).** Output `vault_vout` pays exactly `amount` sats to a script that is **byte-equal** to `instantiate(vault_template, this asset_id, agg_key, epoch)` (§3.1.1 — NUMS internal key + ordered BitVM2 assert/challenge/disprove tapleaf set; **no** depositor or cooperative refund leaf), **and** `agg_key` is admitted via the **two-level** chain rooted at this asset's `operator_set_root` **policy**: `agg_key` is the aggregate of the epoch's registered set whose `reg_root_E` was validly formed under policy P, membership proven **against the root exposed by `C_lcp`**, and the outer circuit `C` **MUST** check `C_lcp.operator_set_root == IssuanceTerms_v3.operator_set_root` (asset-bound **policy-root** equality — §3.3.1). How `reg_root_E` / `agg_key_E` are formed and validated (bond, PoP, MuSig2 KeyAgg, ceremony, canonicity) is specified in **§4.1.2**: in-circuit the LCP establishes PoW-valid commitment of `reg_root_E` at adequate depth (same LCP power as `MoveToBacked` — **not** canonicity); canonicity of `reg_root_E` is the gatekeeper's **R-04** duty (same anchor as `MoveToBacked`); Attack-B safety rests on **R-08**, not on registration completeness (completeness is a liveness residual — §4.1.2). A free-standing boolean `operator_set_member_ok` is **not** sufficient. The recipient commitment of clause (g) (and, in no-gatekeeper mode, the `depositor_base` commitment) is carried as committed leaf data consistent with the deposit → vault path (§4.2).  
     **Attack closed:** without recursive root binding, an attacker proves membership of a self-controlled `agg_key` under an **attacker-chosen** root, a bare `operator_set_member_ok = true` passes, and the outer circuit cannot tell — enabling a foreign-root self-controlled vault drain under an honest asset. Exposing and equating `operator_set_root` makes that *foreign-root* attack fail. **Note:** under open registration this does **not** alone close **Attack B** (self-controlled *in-set* vault under the correct policy root) — that requires **R-08** in gated mode (§3.1.2).
  5. **`MoveToBacked` confirmation depth (MUST — R-01 / R-04 inverted binding).** Confirmations of the `MoveToBacked` block below the proven tip satisfy  
     `depth ≥ D_mint`  
     (and, when an upper slack is configured, `depth ∈ [D_mint, D_mint + S]`),  
     where `D_mint` and optional `S` are normative `PROVISIONAL` parameters (§4.4; on the order of the bridge security horizon, e.g. `D_mint ≈ 2016` blocks — long finality is acceptable per REQ-4).  
     **The mint proves "`MoveToBacked` confirmed at depth ≥ `D_mint`"** — not "vault output unspent in a host-side window." Because the backing-only output `MoveToBacked` creates has **no refund path** (neither depositor nor cooperative — §3.1.1 / §4.2), a settled mint corresponds to a permanent backing-only vault UTXO. That correspondence is proven **in-circuit** and is recursively inherited by every later transition; downstream holders need **no** host-side re-check of Bitcoin vault state or mint freshness. There is **no** in-circuit non-spend-to-tip proof, **no** host-side freshness rule, **no** `tip_height` ProofData field, and **no** mint-window CSV race against a refund leaf (there is none).
- **(f) Genesis binding / uniqueness.** `prev_account_state.send_counter == 0` **and** `prev_account_state.current_pubkey == Pk_mint` (see §3.2). Combined with first-occurrence on `Pk_mint`, a second settled mint against the same vault outpoint is impossible.
- **(g) Recipient binding.** The deposit taproot commits

  ```
  recipient_commitment = H("zkCoins/v2/DepositRecipient", recipient ‖ rc_blind)
  ```

  in the taproot tree beside the refund leaf (placement is bridge detail, §4.2). The circuit verifies that the minted output coin's `recipient` opens that commitment. Neither the gatekeeper nor any minter **MUST** be able to redirect a mint to a different address after the user has deposited (custody-class protection; same lesson as out-intent / blind-signing findings in the main specification's history).
- **(h) Amount discipline.** `amount == vault-output amount` exactly — the **only** in-circuit amount rule. Denomination membership is bridge-side (§4.4). Emission mirrors token-standard-2 clause (g): for the minted asset `a`, `Out(a) == Mint(a) == amount`, `In(a) == 0`; the mint **MUST NOT** self-credit into balances, `received_coins[]`, or this transition's coin-history; credit only via a later clause-10 receive.

**Dispatch.** TS3 is one more branch of the **same** circuit `C`. The v2 circuit ships standards 1, 2, and 3 as branches so the new lineage universe is complete from genesis (§3.7). Adding the branch extends the version dispatch of specification.md §2.1 clause 3, which today accepts only `issuance_version == 1` or `2` on the v1 surface; on the v2 surface the accepted set is `{1, 2, 3}`.

#### 3.3.1 LCP sub-proof interface (normative sketch)

The recursive LCP is a separate circuit `C_lcp` (name provisional) whose public outputs feed the TS3 mint branch. Minimum public interface:

```
LCP_Public = {
  checkpoint_hash,          // pinned Bitcoin header hash (circuit / S2C parameter of the v2 release)
  tip_hash,                 // proven tip
  cumulative_work,          // total work from checkpoint to tip
  vault_txid,               // 32-byte MoveToBacked txid (the vault outpoint, NOT the user deposit)
  vault_vout,               // u32
  vault_amount,             // u64 sats
  vault_script_bytes,       // exact scriptPubKey of the backing-only vault output
  agg_key,                  // 32-byte N-of-N aggregate key used in instantiate (presigning set is N-of-N)
  epoch,                    // u64 deposit epoch used in instantiate
  operator_set_root,        // 32-byte **policy** root proved against (open-registration policy;
                            //   agg_key admitted via epoch registration commitment under this policy)
                            //   (MUST — R-02)
  reg_root,                 // 32-byte epoch registration commitment reg_root_E (two-level chain §3.1.2);
                            //   commits the set of operators validly registered for this epoch under policy P;
                            //   formed and checked per §4.1.2 (bond, PoP, Merkle commitment, KeyAgg);
                            //   in-circuit: PoW-valid commitment at adequate depth (same LCP power as
                            //   MoveToBacked — canonicity NOT established in-circuit; gatekeeper R-04
                            //   is the canonicity anchor for reg_root_E as for MoveToBacked)
  n_of_n_witness_ok,        // boolean / bit: MoveToBacked spent the deposit via the N-of-N vault leaf
  recipient_commitment,     // as in clause (g)
  depositor_base_commitment,// present / opened in no-gatekeeper mode; zero sentinel otherwise
  depth                     // confirmations of MoveToBacked below tip; MUST be ≥ D_mint
                            //   (optionally ≤ D_mint + S when upper slack is configured)
}
```

**Recursive operator-set root binding (MUST — closes self-controlled-root attack).** `C_lcp` **MUST** expose the `operator_set_root` it proved membership against as a public output; the two-level admission proof inside `C_lcp` is against **that** policy root (policy root → epoch `reg_root` → `agg_key`). The outer mint circuit `C` **MUST** verify

```
C_lcp.operator_set_root == IssuanceTerms_v3.operator_set_root
```

(equality with the asset-bound **policy** root). `C` **MUST NOT** rely on a free-standing `operator_set_member_ok` boolean: such a boolean can be `true` under an attacker-chosen root while the outer circuit only sees the bit. Equivalently, `C` **MAY** verify the membership Merkle path directly against the asset-bound `IssuanceTerms_v3.operator_set_root` (same root equality, no bare boolean).

**Attack closed (foreign-root).** Without this binding an attacker proves membership of a self-controlled `agg_key` under an **attacker root**, sets `operator_set_member_ok = true`, and the outer circuit cannot distinguish that from membership under the honest asset root → unbacked mint under a foreign-root self-controlled vault, redeemable cross-graph against honest vaults (drain). Root equality makes the *foreign-root* attack fail: a foreign root does not equal `IssuanceTerms_v3.operator_set_root`. Under open registration this does **not** alone close **Attack B** (self-controlled *in-set* vault) — that requires **R-08** in gated mode (§3.1.2).

The mint branch **MUST** check equality of `vault_amount` with `asset_issuance.amount`, **byte-equality** of `vault_script_bytes` with `instantiate(vault_template, this asset_id, agg_key, epoch)`, `C_lcp.operator_set_root == IssuanceTerms_v3.operator_set_root`, `n_of_n_witness_ok == true`, depth ≥ `D_mint` (and ≤ `D_mint + S` when upper slack is configured), equality of `recipient_commitment` with the opening used for the minted coin's `recipient`, and (in no-gatekeeper mode) opening of `depositor_base_commitment` consistent with clause (b). The exact bit-encoding of the N-of-N witness check and operator-set membership proof is a BitVM2-graph / launch-parameter detail; the **semantic** requirements (operator-set authentication of the `MoveToBacked` spend; two-level admission of `agg_key` under the **asset-bound** policy `operator_set_root`) are normative here.

#### 3.3.2 Binding via MoveToBacked (normative — R-01 / R-04; replaces host-side freshness)

Host-side mint freshness is **not** a security source under this design. There is **no** `tip_height` ProofData field, **no** inscription-height rule `h_inscr < tip_height + W`, **no** freshness window `W`, and **no** mint-window CSV term `D_mint + S + W + 1`.

Soundness of settled mint ↔ permanent backing rests on:

1. **`MoveToBacked` is a fixed pre-signed graph transaction** (content fixed at setup → txid fixed → the downstream reimbursement graph stays pre-signable). It is nullifier-free and ordinary on Bitcoin. It **consumes** the depositor-refundable deposit output and **creates** the backing-only vault output (§4.2).
2. **Firing requires a co-sign gate (consent + anti-griefing — MUST; INV-01).** `MoveToBacked` **MUST** require the **depositor's co-signature in both modes** (gatekeeper and no-gatekeeper) — so the contribution to the shared reserve is **consented**, not imposed. In **gatekeeper mode**, the **gatekeeper's co-signature is additionally required** (anti-griefing: a third party cannot fire after a gatekeeper refusal). Implementation: a co-sign tapleaf or additional required signature(s) on the pre-signed `MoveToBacked` path.
3. **The mint LCP proves `MoveToBacked` confirmed at depth ≥ `D_mint`** (clause (e) point 5) on *some* header chain. Because the backing-only output has **no** refund path, that confirmation is a permanent commitment of the deposited BTC to the vault graph **on the proven chain**.
4. **Canonical-chain anchor at mint settlement (MUST — R-04; gatekeeper mode; covers `MoveToBacked` and `reg_root_E`).** The LCP alone does **not** bind the proven header chain to the verifier's **canonical** Bitcoin view — neither for `MoveToBacked` nor for `reg_root_E` (same LCP limit; §4.1.2). In gatekeeper mode, the gatekeeper **withholds** the final `Pk_mint` signature until it has verified, on its **own canonical Bitcoin view**, that (i) `MoveToBacked` is confirmed at depth ≥ `D_mint` on the canonical chain and the deposit was not refunded there, **and** (ii) the epoch's `reg_root_E` is the canonical registration commitment for that epoch (§3.2.1.1 / §4.1.2). Co-signed `MoveToBacked` alone is insufficient (setup signatures are valid on any fork). In no-gatekeeper mode this external anchor is absent — another reason Corner C of the sound-deployment trilemma is **UNSOUND** (§3.2.1.2, §6.4).
5. **No host-side re-check for downstream holders.** Downstream CoinProof receivers inherit the in-circuit statement recursively; they **MUST NOT** be required to re-check Bitcoin vault unspentness or mint inscription freshness. (The gatekeeper's canonical check is a **mint-time** observer role, not a transitive holder duty.)

### 3.4 Deep-finality canonicity (normative)

The LCP proves `MoveToBacked` at depth ≥ `D_mint` on a PoW-valid header chain (deep enough that private-fork mining for the mint value is economically irrational as a pure mining attack) **and** the N-of-N witness (clause (e) point 3) **and** operator-set membership (clause (e) point 4), including that `reg_root_E` is committed on a PoW-valid chain at adequate depth. That is **necessary but not sufficient** to bind the mint to the **canonical** Bitcoin chain: the LCP proves confirmation on *some* header chain, not that that chain is the verifier's canonical tip — for **either** `MoveToBacked` **or** `reg_root_E`.

**Gatekeeper mode (closes R-04).** Canonical binding is supplied by the **gatekeeper as canonical-chain anchor** (§3.2.1.1): mint settlement requires the gatekeeper's `Pk_mint` signature, and the gatekeeper issues it **only after** confirming on its **own canonical Bitcoin view** that (i) `MoveToBacked` (depth ≥ `D_mint`, deposit not refunded) is canonical **and** (ii) `reg_root_E` is the canonical registration commitment for the epoch (not a private-fork / substituted root). Private-fork `MoveToBacked` or a substituted `reg_root_E` therefore cannot settle a mint. Downstream CoinProof receivers **MUST NOT** be required to re-check Bitcoin deposit/vault canonicity: the vault outpoint and its canonicity opening are **not** transitively available through later transfers (parent specification.md deliberately lets a verifier validate the latest proof without fetching prior transitions), and under the deep-finality + N-of-N + operator-set + backing-only + **gatekeeper canonical-anchor** construction they are **no longer needed** for later holders.

**No-gatekeeper mode (R-04 and R-08 not closed).** With depositor-anchored `Pk_mint`, there is **no external canonical observer** (Attack A open; no anchor for `MoveToBacked` or `reg_root_E`) and **no operator-set-diversity vouch** (Attack B open). Private-fork amortization and self-controlled Sybil-epoch → cross-graph drain remain open under open registration; **Corner C** of the sound-deployment trilemma (no-gatekeeper + open registration + pooled cross-graph) is **UNSOUND** — see §3.2.1.2 and §6.4. This mode **MUST NOT** be presented as trust-minimized pooled backing.

Soundness source:

- The LCP binds the mint to a confirmed **`MoveToBacked`** that created a **backing-only** vault UTXO (no depositor refund, no cooperative refund), not a historical user-deposit inclusion and not a "vault still unspent" host-side claim.
- Depth ≥ `D_mint` makes pure private-fork fabrication of `MoveToBacked` economically irrational at the mint value as a mining cost; the N-of-N witness excludes refund-leaf private-fork forgeries without full operator collusion at setup. **Neither alone binds the proven chain to the canonical tip** — that is the gatekeeper's mint-signing duty (R-04), covering **both** `MoveToBacked` **and** `reg_root_E`.
- NUMS internal key + pre-signed-graph-only leaves (no live free-form CHECKSIG) keep vault spends on the BitVM2 assert/challenge/disprove graph only.
- `C_lcp.operator_set_root == IssuanceTerms_v3.operator_set_root` excludes attacker-supplied self-controlled operator sets under a *foreign* root (membership is against the exposed, asset-bound policy root — not a bare boolean). Under open registration this does **not** alone close **Attack B** (self-controlled *in-set* vault); that requires **R-08** in gated mode (§3.1.2). Registration completeness of `reg_root_E` is a **liveness/fairness** residual, not a safety property — Attack-B safety is R-08 (§4.1.2).
- There is **no** host-side freshness machinery and **no** refund-vs-mint-window CSV race (backing-only has no refund leaf).

**Optional first-recipient check (SHOULD).** The first recipient of a TS3-minted coin (who holds the vault data out-of-band with the mint delivery) **SHOULD** additionally confirm that `(vault_txid, vault_vout)` is present at depth ≥ `D_mint` in **its own** canonical chain view. This is a defence-in-depth hygiene check, not a soundness requirement for later holders (and does not replace the gatekeeper's mint-time canonical-anchor duty for `MoveToBacked` and `reg_root_E`).

**Residual (accepted, D-16 class).** A reorg deeper than `D_mint` that orphans the proven `MoveToBacked` is a bounded accepted finality boundary (risks.md D-16 class; report-intern constraint 21). It is not closed by transitive canonicity transport.

**Residual (accepted, consented irrevocable reserve contribution — R-01 / INV-01).** If `MoveToBacked` fires but the mint never settles, the vaulted BTC is **not** merely frozen recoverable BTC: because reimbursement is cross-graph (any same-asset in-set vault can back a redeem), it becomes an **irrevocable, consented contribution to the shared reserve** and **MAY** be consumed by another holder's redeem. Firing requires the **depositor's co-signature in both modes** (§3.3.2 / §4.2), so the contribution is **consented**, not imposed. The depositor's unilateral escape for the "never processed / never `MoveToBacked`" case remains the pre-`MoveToBacked` deposit refund leaf.

### 3.5 Redeem transition (normative)

A redeem is an ordinary holder transition on the **v2 circuit surface**, not a separate ProofType and not a global SMT insertion.

#### 3.5.1 Balance shape

- `In(zkBTC) == redeem_amount`
- `Out(zkBTC) == 0` (no outputs of the asset; the difference is burned by conservation no-inflation — intentional value destruction for peg-out)
- `redeem_amount` **MUST** be an available payout denomination of the current bridge epoch (bridge rule §4.4). In-circuit, only the commitment binds the amount; denomination membership is enforced by the bridge when accepting a redemption request.

#### 3.5.2 ProofData field (v2 layout)

The v2 `ProofData` layout is the six v1 fields plus one new field (exact serialization pin in §3.7.2):

```
redeem_commitment = Hc("zkCoins/v2/RedeemCommit",
                       asset_id ‖ redeem_amount ‖ btc_recipient ‖ max_fee ‖ redeem_blind)
```

- Hiding: chain observers see only the field digest inside `H(ProofData)`, not the opening of `redeem_commitment`.
- `btc_recipient` is a 32-byte x-only taproot key; the payout output is P2TR to it.
- **`max_fee` (MUST — NH-03):** a `u64` satoshi ceiling on the operator's fee, committed inside `redeem_commitment`. The commitment **MUST** satisfy `max_fee < redeem_amount`. The payout **MUST** pay `btc_recipient` exactly the non-negative wide-integer difference `redeem_amount − max_fee` as a lower bound — i.e. at least `redeem_amount − max_fee`, computed with the parent §2.6 wide-integer gadgets so there is **no underflow and no zero-payout path from wrapping** (see §3.5.6 and §4.3.2). Binding a **ceiling** rather than an exact fixed fee is deliberate: a fee spike between redeem burn and fronting would otherwise leave the coin permanently unservable (loss of funds). The operator sets its actual fee `≤ max_fee` at fronting time.
- For **non-redeem** transitions (including **TS3 mints** and ordinary transfers), `redeem_commitment` **MUST** equal the all-zero 32-byte sentinel `0x00…00` (32 zero bytes). The circuit **MUST** accept the zero sentinel on non-redeem paths and **MUST** reject a zero sentinel when a redeem path is claimed (when `Out(zkBTC) == 0` and `In(zkBTC) > 0` for this asset under the redeem branch, or an explicit redeem flag if the implementation introduces one as an internal witness bit — either way the public field is non-zero iff a redeem is proven).
- There is **no** `tip_height` field and **no** per-branch tip/freshness sentinel (NEW-HOLE-01 resolved by removal).
#### 3.5.3 Redeem ID is the transition nullifier

**The redeem ID is the transition's own on-chain nullifier `(Pkᵢ, Rᵢ)`.** Sign-to-contract already binds `Rᵢ` to `H(ProofData)` and therefore to `redeem_commitment`. First-occurrence makes the **transition** ID unique. The bridge **MUST** key reimbursement claims on `(Pkᵢ, Rᵢ)`. **No separate redeem-nullifier object exists** (no global `burned_coins_smt`; that BRIDGE_MVP sketch is superseded).

#### 3.5.4 Off-chain opening and bridge consumption

The holder reveals the opening `(redeem_amount, btc_recipient, max_fee, redeem_blind)` **off-chain** to the bridge / operators as the redemption request. Chain observers see only that some transition happened (until a reimbursement claim marker appears — §8.2). The bridge fraud-proof circuit consumes the opening together with the settled nullifier. Third parties can be shown a specification.md §5.6-style trail for the redeem transition when the holder discloses the bundle.

#### 3.5.5 Transition uniqueness vs reimbursement uniqueness

- **Transition uniqueness:** one redeem transition = one `(Pkᵢ, Rᵢ)`. Re-proving the same transition cannot re-anchor: first-occurrence rejects a second publication of `Pkᵢ`. First-occurrence gives **transition** uniqueness, **not** reimbursement uniqueness.
- **Reimbursement uniqueness (MUST — claim-consumed marker):** first-occurrence alone does **not** prevent the same redeem ID from reimbursing multiple vault UTXOs across independent per-deposit BitVM2 graphs. Binding a specific free vault outpoint into `redeem_commitment` is **not** constructible (the holder does not know which free outpoint will serve the claim at redeem time; two holders binding the same outpoint would permanently strand the second burn). Instead:
  1. The operator's **claim transaction publicly commits the redeem ID `(Pkᵢ, Rᵢ)`** on Bitcoin (a **claim-consumption marker**).
  2. The reimbursement fraud statement includes the conjunct: **no prior confirmed, valid, unchallenged reimbursement claim carries the same `(Pkᵢ, Rᵢ)`** (§4.3.2) — **slashed / successfully-counterproved / failed markers are excluded** from the uniqueness set (NEW-02).
  3. A second claim for the same redeem is **counterprovable** by a Bitcoin inclusion proof of an earlier **valid unchallenged** claim — the same 1-honest-watchtower challenge class as any other false claim. A malicious operator **MUST NOT** be able to poison a redeem ID with a slashed marker and block an honest retry.
- **Payout binding and claim-marker uniqueness (MUST — NH-02 / NEW-02):** the payout is an ordinary P2TR owned by `btc_recipient`; the operator **cannot** spend it (no key), so "consume the payout outpoint" is **not** a literal UTXO spend. Instead:
  1. Define a **claim-marker namespace**: the operator's reimbursement claim publicly commits the tuple `(Pkᵢ, Rᵢ, payout_txid, payout_vout)` as a **first-occurrence marker** in that namespace on Bitcoin.
  2. **Uniqueness = first-marker rule over the valid set only:** a second claim reusing the same `(Pkᵢ, Rᵢ)` **or** the same `(payout_txid, payout_vout)` is **counterprovable** by a Bitcoin inclusion proof of an earlier **valid, unchallenged** marker (same 1-honest-watchtower class as B-05 / claim-consumption). The operator does **not** spend the recipient's UTXO.
  3. **Slashed-marker exclusion (MUST — NEW-02):** only a **valid, unchallenged** claim marker consumes the redeem ID / payout outpoint for uniqueness. A marker that is **slashed**, **successfully counterproved**, or otherwise **failed** under the challenge path is **excluded** from the uniqueness set and **MUST NOT** block a later honest claim for the same redeem ID or payout outpoint.
  4. **Claimant-funded payout by value-accounting (MUST — NEW-02):** the fraud statement **MUST** prove that the **claiming operator funded the payout** by **value-accounting over bonded inputs**, not by mere presence of one bonded-key input. Under `SIGHASH_SINGLE|ANYONECANPAY`, an attacker could attach a small bonded input to a transaction mostly funded by the real operator; a single-input key-equality check is therefore insufficient. Exact rule (§4.3.2 item 12):
     - each input **signed by the claimant's bonded key** contributes its value to the claimant's funding sum;
     - inputs **not** signed by the claimant's bonded key are **value-ignored** (contribute **zero** to the claimant's funding);
     - the summed value of claimant-controlled inputs **MUST** cover **payout amount + mining fee**.
  5. **Ordering (keep):** the payout confirmation height **MUST** be **>** the first-occurrence height of `(Pkᵢ, Rᵢ)`.
  6. "**Consume**" in this document means the logical first-marker over the **valid unchallenged** set, **not** a UTXO spend. This closes historical/reused-output replay without requiring the operator to control the payout key, and without letting a slashed poison-marker freeze an honest redeem.
#### 3.5.6 Payout template mapping (bridge-facing)

The holder supplies a payout template using `SIGHASH_SINGLE | ANYONECANPAY`:

- Output 0 (or the signed output index): P2TR to `btc_recipient`, amount **≥ `redeem_amount − max_fee`** where `max_fee < redeem_amount` and the subtraction is an exact non-negative wide-integer (NH-03; §2.6 gadgets); the operator's actual fee is market-set at fronting time subject to that ceiling — §4.4.
- Any operator **MAY** fund the input side from **its own funds**.

The bridge fraud statement binds this template's paid output to the opening of `redeem_commitment`. An operator that pays a different address, or pays strictly less than `redeem_amount − max_fee`, **MUST** fail the reimbursement claim under an honest challenge path.

#### 3.5.7 Why not a separate BurnProof or burned SMT

Earlier research (`BRIDGE_MVP.md` §4, `BITVM_BRIDGE.md` §4) proposed a dedicated `BurnProof` ProofType emitting public `(burn_amount, btc_recipient, withdrawal_nonce)` and a global `burned_coins_smt`. That design is incompatible with:

- post-#97 on-chain nullifiers as the sole Bitcoin-published object `(Pkᵢ, Rᵢ)`;
- specification.md §2.2 single circuit `C` (InitialProof / AccountUpdateProof only);
- specification.md §6.5 version-branch dispatch for issuance (redemption is a holder transition, not a new ProofType).

The TS3 design reuses ordinary AccountUpdateProof transitions: value leaves circulation by `Out == 0` with a non-zero `redeem_commitment`, and uniqueness is the existing first-occurrence rule. No new on-chain object is introduced for burns.

### 3.6 Supply auditability

**Publicly verifiable from chain data alone = a conditional upper bound (MUST — M-04):**

```
circulating zkBTC  ≤  BTC locked in the public vault UTXO set
```

This inequality is a **conditional audit property**, not an unconditional invariant. It holds **under the reserve-safety assumptions of §5**: per-epoch **1-of-N setup honesty** (at least one honest signer deleted / refused a malicious graph) **AND R-04 (canonical anchor — no Attack A)** **AND R-08 or genesis enumeration (operator-set diversity — no Attack B)** **AND ≥1 honest challenger** enforcing the §4.3.2 fraud-statement rule (no successful unchallenged fraudulent/duplicate reimbursement) — i.e. **no successful Attack A, no successful Attack B, and no unchallenged fraudulent reimbursement**. Concrete counterexamples that **break** the inequality: (i) a successful **Attack A** (private-fork unbacked mint via skipped/absent R-04) mints against a non-canonical vault that is refunded on the canonical chain → circulating zkBTC with no remaining canonical vault balance; (ii) a successful **Attack B** (self-controlled Sybil-vault drain, absent or failed R-08) mints against a real vault then drains that vault via a presigned malicious graph → circulating zkBTC exceeds remaining honest backing for that vault (and, via cross-graph redeem, can drain other vaults); (iii) an **unchallenged fraudulent or duplicate reimbursement claim** (Redeem-Safety residual — §4.3.1/§5): an operator appropriates vault value without a valid redeem, or reimburses twice; vault balance falls while circulating does not — closed by the §4.3.2 fraud-statement rule **plus** at least one honest challenger/watchtower. Under those assumptions, any observer can sum the public vault UTXOs on Bitcoin and treat that sum as a ceiling on circulating zkBTC (a mint requires a matching vault-output amount under clause (e)/(h); minting without *some* vault backing is in-circuit impossible under the TS3 rules — but Attack A/B **or** an unchallenged fraudulent reimbursement drain or void the *backing* after or instead of a real canonical mint).

**Exact circulating figure is not protocol-enforced from chain data alone.** Parent nullifiers reveal no amount or asset, and proof validity remains off-chain (specification.md §3.1 / §3.2). An observer **cannot** distinguish vaulted-but-never-minted deposits or slot-burned mints from successfully minted ones without off-chain proofs. Public deposits and later payouts permit **correlation**, not protocol-level equality of

```
circulating  ==  Σ vaulted  −  Σ redeemed
```

Aggregate circulating supply therefore remains a **conditional upper bound** (`circulating ≤ current backing vault balance` under the reserve-safety assumptions of §5: **1-of-N + R-04 + R-08/genesis + ≥1 honest challenger**; a successful Attack A, Attack B, **or** unchallenged fraudulent reimbursement breaks it). It is **not** exactly computable from chain data alone.

**Published attestation ledger (for exact audit — optional).** Exact circulating supply requires a **published aggregate mint-minus-redeem attestation** (or equivalent proof/opening ledger). Note carefully:

- A specification.md **§5.7-style balance attestation proves one account**, not aggregate supply. It **MUST NOT** be implied that §5.7 alone yields the circulating total.
- If an **aggregate** mint-minus-redeem attestation is offered, it **MUST** be defined as such (a separate attestation form), not smuggled in under §5.7.
- **Without** such a ledger, only the upper bound plus public deposit/payout correlation exists — **not** protocol-enforced equality.

**Default published form (SHOULD).** Because publishing raw redeem openings would deanonymize `btc_recipient`, the default published form for holder-facing audit **SHOULD** be a **specification.md §5.7-style balance attestation** (per account), not raw openings. Raw openings **MAY** be disclosed under holder consent or legal process; they are not the default public audit surface. Aggregate exact supply, if published, uses the separate aggregate attestation form above.

**Contrast token standard 1:** mint amounts are not publicly summable at all (report-intern constraint 5; risks.md D-13). TS3 improves on TS1 by binding every mint to a public vault UTXO (upper-bound audit) and by enabling optional published attestations for exact figures.

**Honest trade-off:** vault deposit amounts and L1 payout amounts remain public by L1 visibility; internal transfers stay fully shielded (REQ-2 intact). Exact supply equality is an attestation/ledger property, not a pure chain-scan invariant. The default remains the **conditional** upper bound (under the reserve-safety assumptions of §5: **1-of-N + R-04 + R-08/genesis + ≥1 honest challenger**; broken by Attack A, Attack B, **or** unchallenged fraudulent reimbursement) + optional attestation, not raw openings.

### 3.7 Protocol-version consequence (v1 freeze) and migration

TS3 requires new circuit digests. Per specification.md §1.7.8 (v1 freeze): any change to the frozen circuit surface defines a **new protocol version** with **new digests and new lineages**; v1 artefacts are never edited in place.

**Normative migration / coexistence rules:**

1. zkBTC exists **only** in the v2-circuit universe. There is **no** cross-version receive between v1 and v2 lineages (cyclic recursion requires fixed verifier data within a lineage).
2. Existing v1 assets are unaffected and **MUST NOT** migrate implicitly into v2.
3. The v2 circuit **MUST** ship **all** standards (1, 2, and 3) as branches so the new universe is complete from genesis — creators of non-zkBTC assets can still issue under TS1/TS2 on v2.
4. ProofData layout v2 = six v1 fields + `redeem_commitment` (§3.7.2), with a new `circuit_digest(C)` pin for the v2 circuit. **`C_balance` is re-pinned for v2** (§3.7.2 — M-02): both digests change.
5. From the v2 release onward, §1.7.8-style freeze discipline applies to the **v2** surface: further changes are further version bumps, not in-place edits.

#### 3.7.1 Coexistence table

| Asset class | Circuit universe | Can receive from v1 lineage? | Notes |
|-------------|------------------|------------------------------|-------|
| Pre-existing v1 TS1/TS2 assets | v1 | Yes (within v1) | Frozen; unchanged |
| New TS1/TS2 assets issued on v2 | v2 | No | Same standard rules, new digests |
| zkBTC (TS3) | v2 only | No | Requires LCP + redeem field |
| Transitional bridged asset (§9) | v1 (TS1) | Yes (within v1) | Not named zkBTC |

Wallets **MUST** key assets by `asset_id` and circuit lineage, never by display name alone. A UI **MUST NOT** present a transitional asset under the zkBTC product name (§9).

#### 3.7.2 v2 circuit surface (pinned)

This subsection pins the consensus-relevant cryptographic surface for the v2 release. All values below are protocol constants of that release; changing any of them is a version bump.

**ProofData order and serialization (MUST — M-02).**

v1 `ProofData` (specification.md §1.4) is the six 32-byte digests in this order — **192 bytes**:

```
serialize(ProofData_v1) :=
    new_account_state_hash ‖ output_coins_root ‖ input_nullifiers_root
  ‖ coin_history_root ‖ nav_commitment ‖ npk_commit
```

v2 appends one field after the six v1 fields:

- **field 7** `redeem_commitment` — 32-byte Poseidon digest.

A **TS3 mint** therefore exposes:

```
{ six v1 fields, redeem_commitment (= zero-sentinel for a mint) }
```

A non-mint transition (including redeem) exposes:

```
{ six v1 fields, redeem_commitment (non-zero iff redeem) }
```

```
serialize(ProofData_v2) :=
    serialize(ProofData_v1) ‖ redeem_commitment
```

Total length: **224 bytes** (192 + 32). This is the pin **before** the short-lived `tip_height` extension was added and then removed (NEW-HOLE-01 / R-04 invert): host-side freshness and the 8-byte `tip_height` field are **gone**. `H(ProofData) := SHA-256(serialize(ProofData_v2))` for all v2 transitions (S2C binding unchanged in structure; preimage length grows from 192 → 224).

**Zero sentinels (MUST).**

| Field | Non-applicable path | Sentinel |
|-------|---------------------|----------|
| `redeem_commitment` | non-redeem (incl. mint) | 32 zero bytes |

There is **no** `tip_height` field and **no** tip/freshness per-branch sentinel.

**Public-input limb positions for the new field.**

Parent v1 layout for `C` (specification.md §2.5): six ProofData fields = five Poseidon digests (**20** field elements) + `npk_commit` (**8 × u32 limbs**) = **28** elements from `ProofData`, then `consumed_pubkey` (**8**), then `network_id` (**4**) — **40** application public-input elements.

v2 inserts `redeem_commitment` (Poseidon digest, **4** Goldilocks field elements) as field 7 **immediately after** `npk_commit` and **before** `consumed_pubkey`:

| Region | Elements | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| ProofData fields 1–5 (Poseidon) | 20 | unchanged |
| `npk_commit` (SHA-256, 8 × u32 LE limbs) | 8 | unchanged |
| **`redeem_commitment` (Poseidon, 4 elements)** | **4** | **new — field 7** |
| `consumed_pubkey` | 8 | unchanged position after ProofData |
| `network_id` | 4 | unchanged last application PI |
| **Total application PI** | **44** | was 40 on v1 |

A conforming verifier reads `serialize(ProofData_v2)` from the first **32** public-input elements' encodings (20 + 8 + 4), `consumed_pubkey` from the next **8**, and `network_id` from the final **4**.

**`C_balance` re-pin (MUST — M-02).** `C_balance` **cannot** remain byte-identical under a v2 `C`. It recursively verifies a `C` proof under pinned `C` verifier data (parent specification.md §783 / §1092), so a new v2 `C` changes `C_balance`'s embedded verifier data and digest. **Both** `C` and `C_balance` receive new v2 digests: `circuit_digest(C)` **and** `circuit_digest(C_balance)` **MUST** be re-pinned for the v2 release (one pair per network tag). There is **no** "C_balance unchanged by TS3" claim.

**`genesis_tag`.** `AssetIdV3` reuses the v1 `genesis_tag` value: the fixed constant ASCII string **`zkCoins/v1/genesis`** (specification.md §1.4). Do **not** invent a new genesis tag for TS3.

**Reused v1 surface (MUST NOT change).** v2 reuses v1's `m_state` strings, network tags (`zkCoins/v1/mainnet` \| `testnet` \| `regtest`), activation parameters, and accumulator namespace **unchanged**. The **only** circuit-surface additions for TS3 are: the `redeem_commitment` field, the TS3 mint/redeem branches of `C`, the recursive LCP interface consumed by clause (e) (`MoveToBacked` confirmation), and the re-pinned `C_balance` verifier data. A new `circuit_digest(C)` **and** a new `circuit_digest(C_balance)` **MUST** be pinned for the v2 circuit (one pair per network tag).

**LCP consensus / S2C inputs (MUST pin).** The following are consensus parameters of the v2 release (circuit constants and/or S2C-relevant public inputs of `C_lcp` / the mint branch):

- LCP **checkpoint header** hash (and its height);
- **`D_mint`** and optional upper slack **`S`** (§3.3(e), §4.4). There is **no** freshness window `W`.

**Recursion-only values (MUST NOT enter on-chain public inputs).** The redeem-branch values required by the reimbursement statement (In/Out/redeem_amount openings, recursive proof of the TS3 redeem branch — §4.3.2) are exposed **only** to the reimbursement / fraud circuit via recursive verification. They **MUST NOT** enter the on-chain public-input surface of `C` or of any Bitcoin-published object. A redeem transition therefore remains on-chain indistinguishable from any other transition **until** an operator's reimbursement claim marker appears (§8.2).

## 4. Bridge profile — BitVM2-based reserve (the off-circuit half)

### 4.0 Construction decision and maturity gate

**Decision (works-today):** the zkBTC bridge is built on **BitVM2** — the mainnet-proven BitVM-family verifier — with **open permissionless operator registration** (§4.1.1). No federation-multisig V0. No dependency on any not-yet-mainnet construction.

**Rationale (facts + design choice):**

| Claim | Status | Source |
|-------|--------|--------|
| BitVM2 bridge live on Bitcoin mainnet (Bitlayer Jul 2025; Citrea Clementine live Jan 2026) | Fact | `bitvm.org/bitvm_bridge.pdf`; `docs.citrea.xyz`; blockworks BitVM implementation-stage |
| BitVM2: permissionless CHALLENGE (anyone with a full node) | Proven core property | `bitvm.org/bitvm2`; `bitvm_bridge.pdf` |
| BitVM2: operators pre-defined **per instance/epoch**; open **registration** is a product/ops layer (GOAT `registerPubkey`+stake; Fiamma open co-signers) | Fact + our design | GOAT bitvm2-node; Fiamma operators docs |
| Worst-case on-chain dispute cost under BitVM2 is high (~$16k class); BitVM3/Glock/Mosaic reduce it ~1000× (→ lower minima) as a **future upgrade** | Research | `bitvm.org/bitvm3.pdf`; eprint 2026/933; 2025/1485; 2026/812 |
| Plonky2 → BitVM2 (SNARK/Groth16) predicate conversion of the zkCoins compliance predicate — integration track (a) | Open engineering | — |
| Open operator-registration market (policy encoding, bond / anti-domination calibration, `reg_root_E`, ceremony) — track (b); semantics §4.1.2 | Open engineering / calibration | — |

**Historical note (superseded):** the June-2026 decision recorded a Glock-only path with no BitVM2 intermediate (`bitvm-bridge-research.md`). That framing is **historical**. This document re-bases on mainnet-proven BitVM2; Glock/BitVM3/Mosaic remain §10.1 efficiency upgrades only.

**Verifier abstraction.** The verifier is behind a trait. **BitVM2 is normative.** Glock / BitVM3 / Mosaic values are **future efficiency reference baselines** (§10), not inherited protocol properties. Clementine / Bitlayer are the **today** reference deployments.

#### Maturity gate (blocking — design document; ready-to-implement on proven components)

BitVM2-mainnet is **CLEARED** (proven). Remaining work is **two tracks** on proven components: (a) the Plonky2→BitVM2 predicate-conversion integration gate (§4.6B / M3), and (b) instantiating and hardening the open operator-registration market (semantics now in §4.1.2; calibration still open per §11 / §4.6A / M2). Both §4.6A REQ-4 gates and §4.6B maturity gates **MUST** clear. This reframes the document from "future design gated on a not-yet-mainnet verifier" to "**ready-to-implement on proven components, with two remaining work tracks**."

### 4.1 Roles

| Role | Function |
|------|----------|
| **User / Minter** | Requests peg-in by depositing; holds and transfers zkBTC; initiates redeem and submits opening + payout template. Any depositor **MAY** mint under the asset's mode (§3.2) |
| **Gatekeeper** (optional) | Per-mint quality authority, **canonical-chain anchor** (R-04: covers **`MoveToBacked` and `reg_root_E`**), and **operator-set-diversity vouch** when `gatekeeper ≠ 0³²`: source-of-funds screening + vault legitimacy + **withholds `Pk_mint` signature until both `MoveToBacked` and `reg_root_E` are confirmed on its own canonical Bitcoin view** (R-04 / Attack A) **and** until the backing epoch's operator set has **at least one independent honest signer (1-of-N-honest basis)** (R-08 / Attack B); produces `Pk_mint` nullifier (approval = admission). **No** peg-out role |
| **Operators** | **N-of-N** co-sign the **pre-signed BitVM2 graph** at setup (`MoveToBacked`, assert/challenge/disprove/payout connectors — **no** cooperative-refund leaf on the backing-only vault), then **delete** signing shares (MUST — NEW-01: presigning set is N-of-N, not t-of-n); front peg-out BTC from own funds; claim vault reimbursement along the pre-signed graph only (**no live vault CHECKSIG** — NEW-01). Aggregate keys **MUST** be admitted by this asset's `operator_set_root` **policy** via the epoch registration commitment (§3.1.2). **Operator registration is open/permissionless (§4.1.1).** |
| **Watchtowers / challengers** | **Permissionless challenging is a delivered BitVM2 property** — anyone running a Bitcoin full node **MAY** challenge a fraudulent reimbursement claim; not restricted to a designated verifier |
| **Security council / admin keys** | **None.** Deliberate divergence from Citrea and Strata reference deployments |

Holders **MAY register** as operators (open/permissionless — §4.1.1) and self-front, subject to the bonded-onboarding cost note in (b).

#### BitVM2-specific role notes

**(a) Permissionless challenging — DELIVERED (BitVM2).** Unlike a designated-verifier construction (Glock), BitVM2's challenge is open: any full-node observer can disprove a fraudulent assert. This is the core reason BitVM2 is the works-today normative verifier. (Glock would *reduce dispute cost* but *reintroduces* designated-verifier challenge — hence §10-only.) **Permissionless challenge** (anyone **MAY** challenge) is a *mechanism-availability* property, delivered by BitVM2; **safety additionally requires that at least one honest challenger actually ACTS** within the relevant window. Availability ≠ guaranteed action. (Residual: §5 residual 3 / residual 6.)

**(b) Operator onboarding cost (BitVM2).** Joining as an operator for an epoch requires participating in that epoch's N-of-N presigning ceremony and posting a bond; per-instance setup cost is real (BitVM2 presign graph). Open registration (§4.1.1) makes join permissionless, but it is a bonded commitment, not a free click — do not assume every retail holder self-registers. BitVM3/Glock (§10) lower this cost later.

**(c) No-council / one-shot watchtower + sequencing-connector close.** Citrea Clementine (BitVM2 reference deployment) and historical Strata carry a **Payout Administrator** specifically against the documented **watchtower one-shot** weakness: a single successful counterproof may permanently weaken a watchtower versus that operator; the PA can burn a connector to block payout. Without a PA, "claims become void" and "claim-gating below capacity" are **not** enforceable in a councilless presigned-graph system (nobody can halt others' presigned claims; K parallel claims would consume K one-shots before slash #1).

**Normative BitVM2-graph construction requirement (replaces the Payout-Administrator function with graph structure):**

- **Per-operator claim serialization:** each operator's claims are chained through a **sequencing connector** so claim `N+1` is spendable only after claim `N` is resolved (reimbursed or slashed).
- A successful counterproof **slashes the operator's bond and burns the sequencing connector**, which really ejects the operator (no further claims possible).
- Consequence: one operator consumes **at most one** watchtower one-shot before removal. The independent-watchtower floor (§4.4) therefore bounds **independent operators**, not sequential claims of one operator.

This is a technical hole closed by graph structure, not a style point.

### 4.1.1 Open permissionless operator registration market

This section specifies the flagship open-operator property of REQ-4: **anyone can be the exit agent (Wechselschalter), including a holder acting as their own.**

1. **Open join (permissionless, MUST).** For each deposit epoch E there is a **registration window** before the epoch's vault graph is set up. **Anyone** **MAY** register as an operator for E by (i) posting the policy-P bond to a bonded/slashable output and (ii) contributing their operator pubkey to the epoch's N-of-N presigning ceremony. No allowlist, no admin approval, no gatekeeper approval (the gatekeeper has **NO** role here — that is mint-only). A holder **MAY** register to be their **own** exit agent.

2. **Epoch setup ceremony (Level 1 — §4.1.2).** The registered set of E runs the BitVM2 N-of-N formation ceremony (bond/PoP/`reg_root_E`/KeyAgg; bounded restart rounds on exclusion), then Level-2 per-deposit graph presign for each deposit, then all delete signing shares (NEW-01). `agg_key_E` and `reg_root_E` are formed per **§4.1.2** (MuSig2 KeyAgg over the completing subset after any restart rounds; Merkle commitment of valid bonded registrations with PoP).

3. **Freeze semantics (MUST state honestly).** After the epoch freeze, the registered set of E is fixed **for reclaim from E's vault** (the pre-signed graph binds those keys — this is the covenant-emulation reality; registration-free reclaim needs §10.2 covenants). Registration for **future** epochs stays permanently open. So "operator set" is open across time (anyone can always join the next epoch), and any given epoch's vault is reclaimable by that epoch's registered operators. Fungibility of the **claim** (`asset_id`) is unaffected: the token is one fungible asset; redeem is cross-graph across all in-set epoch vaults (§4.3).

4. **"Be your own Wechselschalter" — scoped to EXIT (MUST state).** Because registration is open, a holder who wants a guaranteed self-serviced **exit** **MAY** register (once, before an epoch) and thereafter front + reclaim their own redemptions. **Scope (MUST):** "no party can prevent this" refers to a **registered holder serving their own EXIT** along a graph **already presigned at that deposit's setup**. Exit reclaim does not run a live ceremony at exit time, so exit cannot be griefed once the graph exists. Setup-time (peg-in / registration) griefing is handled by §4.1.2 item 5 (Level-1 restart rounds) and the deposit-taproot refund leaf (Level-2) — **not** by this exit claim. This is the concrete meaning of REQ-4's open-operator property for exit.

5. **Irreducible residual (MUST state plainly).** A holder who **never** registers relies on ≥1 registered operator of some in-set epoch being online to front + reclaim. That is a **liveness** dependency, not custody — the operator cannot steal (1-of-N + ≥1 honest live challenger acting in-window; worst case freeze/burn; §5 residual 3). Registration-free unilateral self-reclaim from a pooled vault is **covenant-class** and not available on today's Bitcoin (§10.2).

6. **Anti-domination / anti-Sybil (MUST — ties to launch gate A(1); Attack A vs Attack B — §3.1.2).** Policy P's bond + admissibility predicate **MUST** make single-party domination of an epoch's operator set economically irrational (no single party ≥ half). Otherwise a self-controlled epoch re-opens **Attack B** (self-controlled in-set vault → cross-graph drain — §3.1.2). The economic bond alone is **insufficient** against Attack B under pooled cross-graph reimbursement. In **gatekeeper mode**, Attack A (private-fork amortization) is blocked by **R-04** (canonical-chain anchor for `MoveToBacked` **and** `reg_root_E`) and Attack B is blocked by **R-08** (operator-set-diversity vouch; **1-of-N-honest basis**) — state both distinctly. **Corner C** of the sound-deployment trilemma (no-gatekeeper + open registration + pooled cross-graph) is **UNSOUND** — neither R-04 nor R-08 applies (§3.2.1.2 / §5 residual 9 / §6.4).

7. **Liquidity / competition.** Multiple registered operators compete to front (fee ≤ `max_fee`); the redeeming holder submits the payout template to **any** operator (§4.3). No operator has a privileged claim.

### 4.1.2 Registration commitment, key aggregation, and ceremony robustness

This section specifies the open-registration mechanism that makes the two-level admission of §3.1.2 / §3.3.1 executable. **Semantic requirements are normative now**; concrete registration-output script bytes and `reg_root_E` commitment encoding are **launch parameters** (frozen with the v2 circuit digests, same honesty discipline as §3.1.1 point 4 / NEW-03 connector-byte launch-pin and §4.2.1).

1. **Registration output (bond) format.** Each registrant for epoch E posts a bond of at least the policy-P bond amount to a **slashable registration output** on Bitcoin that commits, in a canonical encoding: `(operator_pubkey, epoch_id E, policy_tag = operator_set_root, proof_of_possession(operator_pubkey))`. The bond output **MUST** be spendable by the epoch's slash/settlement path (so a proven-fraudulent or grief-defaulting operator forfeits it) and returnable to the registrant after the epoch's claim/challenge horizon if unslashed. **MUST** — no registration without a live bond output.

2. **Proof-of-possession (rogue-key defense).** Registration **MUST** include a BIP-327-style proof-of-possession (a signature over a domain-tagged message binding `operator_pubkey` + E) so a registrant cannot register a rogue aggregate-cancelling key it does not control. Duplicate `operator_pubkey` registrations in the same epoch **MUST** be rejected.

3. **`reg_root_E` (epoch registration commitment).** `reg_root_E` = a Merkle commitment over the set of valid registration outputs admitted for epoch E (each satisfying items 1–2 within E's registration window). It **MUST** be published on-chain as part of the epoch anchor (either committed in the epoch's `MoveToBacked` graph anchor leaf or a dedicated epoch-anchor transaction — launch-pinned form) by the epoch's registering operators / coordinator. The in-circuit statement (via `C_lcp`) **MUST** establish: (i) `reg_root_E` is committed on a **PoW-valid header chain at adequate depth** (same LCP power as `MoveToBacked` — **canonicity is NOT established in-circuit**, exactly as §3.4); (ii) every included registrant satisfies items 1–2 (bond ≥ B, valid PoP, no duplicates); (iii) `agg_key_E` is the key-aggregation of exactly the registrant set committed in `reg_root_E`.

   **Canonicity anchor (MUST — R-04 extended; gatekeeper mode).** In gatekeeper mode, the gatekeeper — as part of its **R-04** canonical-view duty **and** its **R-08** diversity vouch — **MUST** confirm on its **own canonical Bitcoin view** that the `reg_root_E` backing this mint's epoch is the **canonical** registration commitment (not a private-fork / substituted root) and that the registered set it commits is the one the gatekeeper vetted for diversity. R-04's canonical anchor therefore covers **both** `MoveToBacked` **and** `reg_root_E`; R-08's diversity vouch inherently requires viewing the actual canonical registered set. In no-gatekeeper mode there is no such anchor — another reason **Corner C** of the sound-deployment trilemma is **UNSOUND** (§3.2.1.2).

   **Completeness / censorship = liveness residual, not safety (MUST state).** Completeness of `reg_root_E` (that every valid bonded registrant is included) is a **liveness/fairness** property, **NOT** a safety property: a censored honest registrant is not harmed in safety terms — it keeps its bond and re-registers in the next epoch; and censoring honest registrants to make a set Sybil-dominated does **not** help an attacker, because the gatekeeper's **R-08** diversity vouch inspects the actual committed set and refuses to sign a mint against a non-diverse epoch. Therefore **Attack-B safety rests on R-08** (gatekeeper diversity vouch), not on registration completeness. **Accepted liveness residual:** a censored registrant may be excluded from serving that epoch (re-registers next epoch); no funds are lost.

4. **Key aggregation.** `agg_key_E := MuSig2 KeyAgg (BIP-327)` over the registrant `operator_pubkey` set in `reg_root_E`, with keys in **lexicographic (sorted) order** (deterministic, order-independent), duplicates rejected, PoP required per item 2. This is the **only** defined aggregation; a bare "aggregate of the set" is insufficient.

5. **Ceremony robustness / anti-grief — bounded restart rounds (MUST).** After the registration window closes, the registered set runs the N-of-N BitVM2 presign within a bounded **overall setup window**. **Per-round presign deadline ≠ setup window (MUST distinguish):** each presign **round** has its **own** deadline; a registrant that fails to complete its presigning share by that **round** deadline is **excluded** and its registration bond is **forfeited/slashed**. Excluding a grief-defaulting registrant **changes** the registered set, hence `agg_key_E` (BIP-327 KeyAgg over a different set), which **invalidates already-collected MuSig2 nonces / partial signatures / graph artifacts** bound to the old aggregate key. A **new round** then begins over the reduced set (new `reg_root_E'` / `agg_key_E'`), with its **own** per-round deadline, so a restart **always has time within the remaining setup window** — the exclusion trigger and the restart do **not** share a single deadline that would leave no time to restart. The **setup window** bounds the **total** number of rounds (and hence the total griefer count, since each excluded griefer forfeits a bond). On each exclusion, prior partial artifacts for the affected graph are **discarded** and a fresh presign round runs over the reduced set. **Re-presign cost (honest):** a griefer imposes a re-run cost, capped by the window and by the bond forfeited per exclusion; it cannot stall indefinitely. Progress is guaranteed while ≥1 registrant completes a full round before the setup window closes. (Exclusion is therefore not "free" — old partial artifacts keyed to the old `agg_key_E` cannot simply be reused over the reduced subset.)

6. **Two-level ceremony architecture (MUST).** Resolve the epoch-ceremony vs per-deposit-ceremony split explicitly:

   - **Level 1 — epoch operator-set formation (once per epoch):** the registration + anti-grief ceremony of item 5 fixes the epoch's registered set → `reg_root_E`, `agg_key_E`. A Level-1 griefer is excluded + slashed + restart (item 5).
   - **Level 2 — per-deposit graph presign (once per deposit, by the epoch's fixed set):** each deposit's BitVM2 transaction graph (§4.2 step 3) is presigned by the epoch's N-of-N set.
     - **One-off Level-2 refusal (single deposit):** a Level-2 griefer that refuses to presign a **specific** deposit's graph does **NOT** strand that depositor: `MoveToBacked` simply never fires for that deposit, so the depositor reclaims via the **deposit-taproot refund leaf** after `refund_timelock` (existing R-01 / INV-01 escape); the Level-2 griefer is slashable for that default. No deposit funds are stuck.
     - **Systematic Level-2 griefing → escalate to Level-1 exclusion (MUST):** a Level-2 member who **repeatedly / systematically** fails per-deposit presigns (not just one deposit) is treated as a **Level-1 default**: it is **slashed and excluded from the epoch set**, triggering a Level-1 restart that re-forms `agg_key_E` / `reg_root_E` without it (item 5). Therefore systematic Level-2 refusal **collapses to Level-1 exclusion** and **cannot indefinitely stall** epoch throughput.

   Setup-time griefing is handled by Level-1 restart / one-off Level-2 deposit refund / systematic Level-2 → Level-1 exclusion. **Exit** reclaim, by contrast, runs along a graph already presigned at that deposit's setup — §4.1.1 point 4 scopes "no party can prevent this" to that exit path only.

7. **Honest launch-pin.** The concrete registration-output script bytes and `reg_root_E` commitment encoding are **launch parameters** (frozen with the v2 circuit digests, NEW-03 style). The **semantic** requirements (items 1–6) are normative now. Implementations **MUST NOT** claim present-day absolute byte-determinism for the registration-output / `reg_root_E` encoding beyond the semantic pins above (same honesty as §3.1.1 point 4 / §4.2.1 connector-byte launch-pinning).

### 4.2 Peg-in (permissionless mint; optional gatekeeper)

Numbered happy path (**deposit taproot** → co-signed **`MoveToBacked`** → **backing-only vault output** → deep mint). These are two distinct UTXOs with cleanly separated rights (R-01 inverted binding; analogous to Clementine's MoveToVault-before-refund, but named `MoveToBacked` here because the output is permanently backing-only):

1. **Deposit preparation (deposit taproot).** The minter constructs a **deposit taproot** address (what the user pays to; pre-`MoveToBacked`). Its script tree includes:
   - vault / bridge leaf consistent with spending into the pre-signed `MoveToBacked` for an `agg_key` admitted by this asset's `operator_set_root` policy via the epoch registration commitment (N-of-N MuSig2 / graph deposit path as required by the graph);
   - **co-sign gate** for firing `MoveToBacked` (MUST — INV-01 consent + anti-griefing): the **depositor's co-signature is required in both modes**; in **gatekeeper mode** the **gatekeeper's co-signature is additionally required** (anti-griefing after refusal). Implementation: a co-sign tapleaf or additional required signature(s) on the pre-signed `MoveToBacked` path;
   - `recipient_commitment` leaf (§3.3(g));
   - in **no-gatekeeper** mode: `depositor_base_commitment` leaf (§3.2.1.2) — **MANDATORY**;
   - **depositor refund leaf** with `OP_CSV` of `refund_timelock` blocks paying the minter (`refund_timelock` is a bridge-epoch parameter — §4.4 — not part of `asset_id`). This leaf is the depositor's **only** unilateral reclaim path and is used **only if `MoveToBacked` never happens**.
2. **User deposit.** Minter broadcasts a Bitcoin transaction paying exactly one allowed denomination amount to that deposit taproot.
3. **Presign (MUST — NEW-01).** The epoch's **openly-registered operators** (§4.1.1) generate and **N-of-N** **pre-sign the entire per-deposit BitVM2 transaction graph** (`MoveToBacked`, assert/challenge/disprove/reimbursement/payout connectors — **no** cooperative-refund transaction on the backing-only vault). Content is fixed at setup → txids fixed → the downstream reimbursement graph stays pre-signable. After setup signatures are complete, per-signer signing shares for those graph transactions **MUST** be **deleted**. The presigning set is **N-of-N**, not a `t < N` threshold (NEW-01 — §2.1).
4. **`MoveToBacked` (MUST — R-01 / R-04 inverted binding + INV-01 consent).** Operators (with the **co-sign gate** of step 1: **depositor always**; **gatekeeper also** in gated mode) execute **`MoveToBacked`**: an **ordinary pre-signed, nullifier-free graph transaction** that spends the user's deposit output **through the vault leaf under the N-of-N (BitVM2 aggregate) signature produced at setup** into a **backing-only** vault UTXO whose scriptPubKey is **byte-equal** to `instantiate(vault_template, asset_id, agg_key, epoch)`. `MoveToBacked` **consumes** the deposit output and thereby **extinguishes** the deposit-taproot refund leaf. Bitcoin UTXO exclusivity is the arbiter between `MoveToBacked` and the deposit refund leaf: `MoveToBacked` **MUST** fire before `refund_timelock`, exactly like Clementine's MoveToVault-before-refund.
5. **Backing-only vault output (MUST — R-01 / NEW-01 / B-01).** The resulting **vault output** (the mint anchor, post-`MoveToBacked`) carries **NO depositor refund leaf and NO cooperative refund leaf**. Its tapleaves are only: the operator/reimbursement leaves + assert/challenge/disprove/sequencing connectors (NEW-01 form: pre-signed graph commitments, **no live `agg_key` CHECKSIG**, CSV = BitVM2 assert/challenge/disprove windows — B-06 / §4.4) and the `asset_id ‖ epoch` commitment leaf (§3.1.1). There is **no** mint-window CSV formula and **no** refund-vs-mint-window race (there is no refund path on this output).
6. **Deep finality window.** `MoveToBacked` becomes mint-eligible only when confirmed at depth **≥ `D_mint`** (optionally ≤ `D_mint + S`) on the chain used for the LCP (§3.3(e), §4.4). Long finality is acceptable per REQ-4. **In gatekeeper mode**, mint settlement further requires the gatekeeper's **own canonical Bitcoin view** to show the same confirmation for `MoveToBacked` **and** for `reg_root_E` (step 7 / R-04).
7. **TS3 mint.**
   - **Gatekeeper-gated (MUST — R-04 canonical anchor + R-08 diversity vouch):** the gatekeeper verifies the mint's witness/inputs (source-of-funds, LCP-proven `MoveToBacked` to the asset's instantiated backing-only vault, committed recipient, `operator_set_root` membership against the asset-bound policy root, and **R-08** operator-set-diversity / 1-of-N-honest check for the backing epoch — §3.2.1.1) **and**, on its **own canonical Bitcoin view**, that (i) `MoveToBacked` is confirmed to depth ≥ `D_mint` on the **canonical** chain, (ii) the deposit output was **not** refunded on the canonical chain, and (iii) `reg_root_E` is the canonical registration commitment for the epoch (R-04 covers both anchors — §4.1.2); **only then** does it sign `m_state` under `Pk_mint` (approval = nullifier admission; **withhold until canonical and diverse**). The final proof `C` is constructed afterward embedding that signature. Clauses (a)–(h) are proven against the **vault outpoint** (N-of-N witness + instance byte-equality + recursive `operator_set_root` equality + `MoveToBacked` depth ≥ `D_mint`). The one-shot mint nullifier `(Pk_mint, R)` is published. Co-signed `MoveToBacked` alone does **not** settle a mint — the gate is the withheld final mint signature (R-04 closes Attack A; R-08 closes Attack B — §3.1.2).
   - **No-gatekeeper:** the depositor signs under depositor-anchored `Pk_mint` (§3.2.1.2); same clauses (a)–(h) with `depositor_base` opening. **Honest limitation:** no external canonical observer (Attack A open; no anchor for `MoveToBacked` or `reg_root_E`) and no operator-set-diversity vouch (Attack B open) — **Corner C** of the sound-deployment trilemma is **UNSOUND** (§3.2.1.2, §5 residual 9, §6.4); **MUST NOT** be marketed as trust-minimized pooled backing.
   - Coin delivery uses ordinary zkCoins delivery to `recipient`. Receivers/bridge **MUST NOT** re-check host-side freshness or vault unspentness: the mint LCP already proves `MoveToBacked` confirmation in-circuit (§3.3.2); canonicity binding of `MoveToBacked` **and** `reg_root_E` to the Bitcoin tip is the gatekeeper's mint-time duty when designated.

**Ordering rule and consented irrevocable contribution residual (R-01 / INV-01).** After `MoveToBacked` there is **no unilateral depositor reclaim** and **no cooperative refund** of the vault-backed BTC. The depositor's unilateral protection is the **pre-`MoveToBacked` deposit-taproot refund** only. If `MoveToBacked` fires but the mint never settles (e.g. gatekeeper/operator fails after `MoveToBacked`), the vaulted BTC is **not** merely frozen recoverable BTC: because reimbursement is cross-graph (any same-asset in-set vault can back a redeem), it becomes an **irrevocable, consented contribution to the shared reserve** and **MAY** be redeemed by another holder — deliberately, so R-01 cannot re-open one level deeper with a refund race. Because `MoveToBacked` fires only with the **depositor's co-signature in both modes** (and the gatekeeper's co-signature additionally in gated mode — step 1 / 4), this contribution is **consented**, not imposed (cross-ref §4.5 no-council / operator-liveness class; §5 residual list). In gatekeeper-gated mode this is an accepted **gatekeeper-liveness residual at entry** (the quality gate, canonical-chain anchor (R-04), and diversity vouch (R-08) *are* mint-time liveness dependencies — §6). In no-gatekeeper mode the residual is depositor operational (co-sign `MoveToBacked` only when accepting the contribution risk / ready to mint). **Attack closed by R-01:** a raw vault refund leaf at `refund_timelock` (~200 blocks) would mature well before the mint window (~2016 blocks), letting a depositor mint **and then** refund → destroy backing; separating the UTXOs and making the post-`MoveToBacked` output permanently backing-only extinguishes that path.

**Failure table:**

| Failure | Outcome |
|---------|---------|
| Gatekeeper refuses **before** `MoveToBacked` (does not co-sign) | Minter reclaims via **deposit-taproot** refund leaf after `refund_timelock`; BTC never stuck on refusal; third parties cannot force `MoveToBacked` (gatekeeper co-sign required in gated mode) |
| Depositor withholds co-signature on `MoveToBacked` | `MoveToBacked` does not fire; minter may reclaim via deposit-taproot refund after `refund_timelock` (INV-01: contribution never imposed) |
| Gatekeeper withholds mint signature after canonical check fails / not yet ready, or R-08 diversity fails | No mint settles; if `MoveToBacked` already fired with depositor (+ gatekeeper) co-sign, BTC is an irrevocable consented reserve contribution (INV-01) |
| Gatekeeper/operator fails **after** `MoveToBacked` (mint never settles) | Vaulted BTC is an **irrevocable, consented contribution to the shared reserve** (cross-graph redeemable by others — not merely frozen recoverable BTC) |
| Operators fail to fire `MoveToBacked` | Minter reclaims via **deposit-taproot** refund leaf after `refund_timelock` |
| Mint settles | Minter/recipient holds zkBTC; backing-only vault remains under pre-signed assert/challenge/disprove graph for later peg-out (**no** live CHECKSIG) |

**Plain statement:** peg-in **depends on the gatekeeper only when one is designated** — that **is** the optional quality gate, the canonical-chain anchor (R-04 / Attack A: covers `MoveToBacked` **and** `reg_root_E`), and the operator-set-diversity vouch (R-08 / Attack B) for mint settlement (including the gated `MoveToBacked` co-sign and the withheld `Pk_mint` signature until canonical confirmation of both anchors **and** diversity). REQ-4 concerns exit only (gatekeeper-independent). Trust-minimized pooled cross-graph backing effectively **requires** that gatekeeper (or equivalent canonical oracle) for both R-04 and R-08 — Corner A of the sound-deployment trilemma (§3.2.1.2 / §5 / §6.4).

#### 4.2.1 Deposit taproot and vault output structure (normative outline)

Exact script templates are launch-time artefacts of the BitVM2 graph compiler (`PROVISIONAL` byte pin — NEW-03). The normative **semantic** requirements on the structure are:

1. **Deposit vault path** spends only into the **pre-signed** `MoveToBacked` under the N-of-N aggregate / MuSig2 path as required by the reference construction — **not** via the user's refund leaf. The aggregate key **MUST** be admitted by `operator_set_root` (policy → epoch `reg_root` → `agg_key`). Signatures for `MoveToBacked` are produced at setup and the signing shares **MUST** then be deleted (NEW-01). Firing **MUST** require the co-sign gate of §4.2 step 1: **depositor co-signature in both modes** (INV-01); **gatekeeper co-signature additionally** in gatekeeper mode.
2. **Recipient commitment path or leaf data** carries `recipient_commitment` so clause (g) can open it; the commitment **MUST** be fixed before the user signs the deposit.
3. **Depositor-base commitment (no-gatekeeper mode)** carries `depositor_base_commitment` so clause (b) can open it; **MANDATORY** when `gatekeeper = 0³²`.
4. **Deposit refund path (deposit taproot only — R-01)** pays the minter after `refund_timelock` CSV **if and only if** `MoveToBacked` does not complete. `MoveToBacked` consumes this output and extinguishes the refund. This is the depositor's **only** unilateral protection.
5. **Vault output script** after `MoveToBacked` **MUST** be byte-equal to `instantiate(vault_template, asset_id, agg_key, epoch)` (§3.1.1 — NUMS internal key + ordered pre-signed-graph tapleaf set; **no** depositor refund leaf; **no** cooperative refund leaf). Byte-equality is relative to the launch-pinned template (NEW-03).
6. **All vault-output value-moving spend paths MUST be CSV-locked to the BitVM2 assert/challenge/disprove windows** (B-06 / §4.4) after `MoveToBacked` confirmation (operator/reimbursement leaf, claim/sequencing connectors). **MUST NOT** include a depositor refund leaf. **MUST NOT** include a cooperative refund leaf. **MUST NOT** include a live free-form `agg_key` CHECKSIG (NEW-01). There is **no** `D_mint + S + W + 1` mint-window CSV term.
7. **Internal key (MUST — NUMS on vault).** The vault output's internal key **MUST** be the unspendable NUMS point of §3.1.1 so there is **no key-path spend**. Deposit outputs **SHOULD** likewise use NUMS or equivalent so that no single party can bypass script paths — matching Clementine/BitVM2 deposit style.
8. **Pre-signed graph only (MUST — NEW-01).** Every vault spend is a pre-committed graph transaction (reimbursement assert/challenge/disprove/payout connectors), each authorised by setup-time N-of-N signatures with keys then deleted. A live CHECKSIG by the current key-holders is **forbidden**. The presigning set is **N-of-N**, not t-of-n.

### 4.3 Peg-out (gatekeeper-independent)

Numbered happy path:

1. **Consolidate.** Holder consolidates internally (shielded transfers) to an available payout denomination of the current epoch.
2. **Redeem transition.** Holder proves a redeem (§3.5): burns the denomination, sets non-zero `redeem_commitment` (incl. `max_fee` with `max_fee < redeem_amount`), anchors `(Pkᵢ, Rᵢ)`.
3. **Request.** Holder submits the opening `(redeem_amount, btc_recipient, max_fee, redeem_blind)` and a payout template (`SIGHASH_SINGLE|ANYONECANPAY`, P2TR to `btc_recipient`, amount ≥ `redeem_amount − max_fee`) to **any registered operator** (open set — §4.1.1).
4. **Front.** **Any registered operator** **MAY** front BTC from **own funds** (not the vault) to the payout template under `SIGHASH_SINGLE|ANYONECANPAY`, choosing an actual fee `≤ max_fee`. The mining fee of the payout transaction is funded by the operator's own input/anchor — **never from vault value**.
5. **Claim.** Operator claims vault reimbursement via the **BitVM2 assert/challenge/disprove** machinery (a **pre-signed graph** path — NEW-01; never a live vault CHECKSIG). The claim transaction **publicly commits the claim-marker tuple `(Pkᵢ, Rᵢ, payout_txid, payout_vout)`** on Bitcoin as a first-occurrence marker in the claim-marker namespace (logical claim-consumption + payout first-marker — §3.5.5 NH-02 / NEW-02). The operator does **not** spend the recipient's payout UTXO. Claims of one operator are **serialized** through that operator's sequencing connector (§4.1 role-note (c)). The claim **MUST** prove the claimant funded the payout by **value-accounting over bonded inputs** (§4.3.2 item 12 / NEW-02).

**Fraud statement (operator reimbursement claim):** the full conjunct list of §4.3.2 (accumulator + S2C + recursive `C` verification + consumed-key binding + redeem branch + asset binding + value preservation + canonical payout under `max_fee` + claim-marker uniqueness over the **valid unchallenged** set + claimant-funded payout by value-accounting). Verified via the **BitVM2** assert/disprove path (SNARK/Groth16 verified optimistically; permissionless challenge). Wrong claims are killed by a permissionless BitVM2 **disprove** transaction (a fraud proof any full-node challenger can post); BitVM3/Glock (§10.1) later compress this to a ~single-signature-scale disprove.

6. **Reimbursement.** After the challenge window without successful challenge, operator takes reimbursement from the vault along the pre-signed graph: the claim **MUST** remove **exactly `redeem_amount`** from the vault (NH-01) — vault-input value minus change-back-to-the-same-vault-descriptor equals `redeem_amount`, with the change output constrained back to the (in-set) vault. The mining fee is funded by the operator's own input/anchor, **never from vault value** (else backing erodes below remaining supply). A second claim for the same `(Pkᵢ, Rᵢ)` or the same payout outpoint is counterprovable by inclusion of an earlier **valid, unchallenged claim-marker** (logical first-marker, not a UTXO spend of the payout; slashed markers excluded — NEW-02).
**The gatekeeper appears nowhere in this path (REQ-4).** Exit is gatekeeper-independent and operator-liveness-bounded.

**Liveness residual (honest):** exit requires ≥ 1 live, liquid, willing **registered** operator. The operator set is **open** (anyone may register to serve, including the holder — §4.1.1), so the residual is *liveness of ≥1 registered operator*, not a privileged party. Landscape shortlist 1 marks this **PARTIAL**; bitvm.org states that without at least one honest operator "the funds become unspendable eventually" (landscape report §2.1 citing `https://bitvm.org/bitvm2`). Dishonest operators cannot steal under 1-of-N setup honesty + ≥1 honest live challenger actually acting within every relevant challenge window (§5 residual 3); worst case under that model is freeze / burn of affected deposits, not silent theft (else unchallenged-fraud drain — §3.6).

**Cross-graph note.** Because peg-out is cross-graph, the fraud statement's asset-equality conjunct (B-04 / §4.3.2 item 6) plus `operator_set_root` membership together ensure a redeem only draws **in-set** vaults of the same asset (same policy root). Under open registration, *in-set* is not alone *1-of-N-honest*: Attack B (self-controlled Sybil epoch under the correct root) is closed at **mint** by R-08 in gated mode, not at redeem (§3.1.2).

#### 4.3.1 Peg-out failure modes

| Scenario | Outcome | Residual class |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| Assigned operator offline | Reassignment after timeout (§4.4); another registered operator fronts | Liveness delay |
| All operators refuse one holder | Exit stalls until some registered operator serves; holder **MAY** have pre-registered as their own operator (§4.1.1) to self-serve | Liveness / ransom |
| All operators disappear | Vault UTXOs locked under presigned paths; no pure user self-spend without covenants (§10.2); holder who never registered cannot reclaim alone | Liveness freeze |
| Holder pre-registered as own operator | Holder **MAY** front + reclaim own redemptions from epochs they registered for (§4.1.1) | Self-served exit (open registration) |
| Operator claims without valid redeem | Permissionless BitVM2 disprove; bond slash + sequencing-connector burn | Safety (if ≥1 challenger acts) |
| Watchtower one-shot vs one operator | Sequencing connector ejects the operator after one successful counterproof (§4.1 role-note (c)); floor covers independent operators | Safety design hole only if floor of independent operators fails |
| Double reimbursement claim for same `(Pkᵢ, Rᵢ)` | Counterprovable by Bitcoin inclusion of earlier **valid unchallenged** claim-marker; slashed markers do not block retry (NEW-02) | Safety (1-honest watchtower) |
| Payout outpoint reused across claims | Counterprovable by first-marker of earlier valid claim-marker tuple (NH-02; logical marker, not UTXO spend); claimant must fund by value-accounting over bonded inputs (NEW-02) | Safety (1-honest watchtower) |
| Free-rider claim on another's payout | Fraud statement fails value-accounting: sum of inputs signed by claimant's bonded key does not cover payout + fee; non-bonded inputs are value-ignored (NEW-02) | Safety |
| Gatekeeper offline or hostile | **No effect** on peg-out | REQ-4 property |

#### 4.3.2 Fraud-statement witness (bridge circuit)

The BitVM2 assert/disprove path that authorises operator reimbursement **MUST** verify a statement equivalent to the **old accumulator + S2C checks PLUS the additions below** — a full conjunct list, not a replacement of the accumulator checks. All of the following **MUST** hold:

```
Exists opening (asset_id, redeem_amount, btc_recipient, max_fee, redeem_blind)
and a redeem transition proof such that:

  1. (Pkᵢ, Rᵢ) is first-occurrence completed on the Bitcoin-derived zkCoins
     nullifier accumulator.
  2. Rᵢ S2C-opens H(ProofData) containing redeem_commitment, where
     redeem_commitment = Hc("zkCoins/v2/RedeemCommit",
                            asset_id ‖ redeem_amount ‖ btc_recipient
                            ‖ max_fee ‖ redeem_blind).
  3. Recursive verification of the redeem transition's C proof under the
     pinned v2 verifier data (parent specification.md §5.6 requires this).
  4. Pkᵢ == redeem_proof.consumed_pubkey
     (§5.6 anti-naked-nullifier binding; specification.md ~2094).
  5. The verified transition took the TS3 redeem branch:
     In(zkBTC) == redeem_amount and Out(zkBTC) == 0
     (proven via the recursive proof — see exposition note).
  6. asset_id in the opening equals the zkBTC asset_id bound to this vault
     (via vault_template / instantiate and operator_set_root; MUST — else a
     self-issued cheap foreign TS3 asset with its own vault and redeem
     could drain this asset's vault). The vault being drawn from MUST have
     agg_key admitted by this asset's operator_set_root.
  7. Fee bounds (NH-03): max_fee < redeem_amount, and
     redeem_amount − max_fee is computed as an exact non-negative
     wide-integer (parent §2.6 gadgets) — no underflow, no zero payout
     from wrapping.
  8. The Bitcoin payout output is P2TR(btc_recipient) with amount
     ≥ redeem_amount − max_fee, confirmed on the canonical chain
     (the receiver's / challenger's own view at deep depth — NOT
     "the operator's claimed chain").
  9. Payout binding (NH-02 — logical claim-marker, not UTXO spend): the
     claim publicly commits the claim-marker tuple
     (Pkᵢ, Rᵢ, payout_txid, payout_vout) as a first-occurrence marker
     in the claim-marker namespace; that payout outpoint's confirmation
     height is strictly greater than the first-occurrence height of
     (Pkᵢ, Rᵢ); a second claim reusing the same (Pkᵢ, Rᵢ) or the same
     (payout_txid, payout_vout) is counterprovable by inclusion of an
     earlier **valid, unchallenged** marker. The operator does NOT spend
     the recipient's UTXO.
 10. Claim-marker uniqueness over the valid set only (NH-02 / NEW-02 —
     §3.5.5): no prior **valid, unchallenged** reimbursement
     claim-marker carries the same (Pkᵢ, Rᵢ) or the same
     (payout_txid, payout_vout). **Exclusion rule (MUST):** a marker that
     is **slashed**, **successfully counterproved**, or otherwise
     **failed** under the challenge path is **excluded** from the
     uniqueness set and MUST NOT block an honest retry. Only a valid,
     unchallenged claim consumes the redeem ID / payout outpoint for
     uniqueness.
 11. Value preservation (NH-01): the reimbursement removes exactly
     redeem_amount from the vault —
       vault_input_value − change_to_same_vault_descriptor
         == redeem_amount
     with the change output constrained back to the same in-set vault
     descriptor. The mining fee is funded by the operator's own
     input/anchor, NEVER from vault value.
 12. Claimant funded the payout by value-accounting (MUST — NEW-02):
     the fraud statement MUST prove the payout is funded by inputs the
     claimant controls. Value-accounting rule:
       - each input signed by the claiming operator's bonded key
         (the key / bond identity registered for this operator in the
         pre-signed graph) contributes its full value to the claimant's
         funding sum;
       - inputs NOT signed by the claimant's bonded key are
         value-ignored (contribute zero to the claimant's funding);
       - the summed claimant-controlled value MUST cover
         payout amount + mining fee.
     Mere presence of one bonded-key input is NOT sufficient: under
     SIGHASH_SINGLE|ANYONECANPAY a front-runner could attach a small
     bonded input to a tx mostly funded by the real operator and steal
     reimbursement. Value-accounting closes that hole.
```

**Fee rule (normative).** `max_fee` is a **ceiling** committed inside `redeem_commitment` with `max_fee < redeem_amount`. Payout **MUST** pay `btc_recipient` at least `redeem_amount − max_fee` (exact non-negative wide-integer subtraction). This is provable and market-viable (the operator sets its actual fee ≤ `max_fee` at fronting time). An **exact** fixed fee **MUST NOT** be bound: a fee spike between redeem burn and fronting would otherwise leave the coin permanently unservable (loss of funds).

**Value-preservation rule (normative — NH-01).** Reimbursement **MUST** remove **exactly `redeem_amount`** from the vault. Any wording that takes `redeem_amount + fee` from the vault is **incorrect**: the fee is operator-funded. Otherwise backing erodes below remaining circulating supply.

**Exposition note (MUST — protects §8.2 until claim).** The redeem-branch values (`In`/`Out`/`redeem_amount`/opening) are exposed **only to the reimbursement circuit via recursive verification**, **NEVER** as on-chain public inputs of `C`. A redeem transition therefore stays on-chain indistinguishable from any other transition **until** the operator's reimbursement claim marker appears; that marker then links the redeem to its payout (§8.2). Cross-check: §3.7.2 "recursion-only values".

Exact packing into BitVM2 public inputs is conversion-path work (§11). The token standard fixes the **semantic** statement so the conversion cannot silently weaken it.

### 4.4 Parameters (normative table)

Denominations, `refund_timelock`, mint-depth parameters, and related deposit-epoch economics are **per-deposit-epoch bridge parameters**, not `IssuanceTerms_v3` fields. Changing them for **new** deposits does not change `asset_id`. Existing vaulted deposits keep the parameters of their epoch's presigned graph. (`refund_timelock` governs the deposit taproot only — consistent with denominations staying outside token identity.) There is **no** mint-freshness window `W` and **no** host-side `tip_height` rule.

| Parameter | Value | Reference baseline | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Denominations (start set)** | **{0.1, 1, 10} BTC** | Clementine 10 BTC; Bitlayer BitVM2 | High minima allowed by REQ-4; re-based on BitVM2/Clementine economics (BitVM2 worst-case dispute cost ~$16k class). BitVM3/Glock (§10.1) later enable lower minima (toward 0.01) once mainnet-proven |
| **0.01 BTC denomination** | **Gated** behind efficiency-upgrade evidence | Earlier research sketches used 0.01 | Under BitVM2, worst-case dispute cost is a larger fraction of a 0.01 deposit than under projected Glock/BitVM3 economics; fee-spike / challenger-collateral weakness hits small denominations hardest; per-deposit graph setup scales with deposit count. Enable **only after BitVM3/Glock mainnet evidence** lowers dispute cost (§10.1) |
| `refund_timelock` | 200 blocks (`PROVISIONAL`) | Clementine / BITVM_BRIDGE | ~33 h unilateral user reclaim on **deposit taproot only** if `MoveToBacked` stalls; **not** on vault output (R-01); **not** in `asset_id` |
| `D_mint` | ~2016 blocks (`PROVISIONAL`) | Bridge security horizon; long finality OK per REQ-4 | Mint LCP: `MoveToBacked` confirmation depth lower bound (§3.3(e)); private-fork mining for mint value economically irrational at this depth |
| `S` | Launch param (`PROVISIONAL`, optional) | — | Mint LCP depth upper slack (when configured: depth ∈ `[D_mint, D_mint + S]`) |
| Vault spend-path CSV | **BitVM2** assert/challenge/disprove windows (B-06; same order as claim challenge window below) (`PROVISIONAL`) | Citrea/Clementine (BitVM2) | Operator/reimbursement + claim/sequencing connectors only — script-path under NUMS; pre-signed graph (no live CHECKSIG); **no** depositor or cooperative refund leaf on backing-only vault (R-01 / NEW-01); locked after `MoveToBacked`. **Not** a mint-window formula |
| Operator reassignment timeout | 504 blocks (`PROVISIONAL`) | Citrea/Clementine (BitVM2) | ~3.5 days before reassignment |
| Claim challenge window | 1064 blocks (`PROVISIONAL`) | Citrea/Clementine (BitVM2) (~1.4 weeks class) | Long windows OK per REQ-4; also pins the vault assert/challenge/disprove CSV order of magnitude (B-06) |
| Operator bond | BitVM2/Clementine-scale; exact = launch param (`PROVISIONAL`) | Clementine ~2 BTC (BitVM2-era) | Must match BitVM2 slash economics at launch pin; slash burns sequencing connector (§4.1 role-note (c)). BitVM3 later lowers required bonds (§10.1) |
| Payout fee | Market-set under `max_fee` ceiling committed in `redeem_commitment` with `max_fee < redeem_amount`; baseline 0.003 BTC (`PROVISIONAL`) | Clementine / BitVM2 ops | Operator keeps fee ≤ `max_fee`; fee never taken from vault (NH-01); no exact fixed fee bound into the commitment |
| Minimum independent watchtower count | **≥ 3** (`PROVISIONAL` floor) | PA replaced by sequencing connectors (Clementine/Strata class one-shot) | Floor bounds **independent operators** (each consumes ≤1 one-shot before ejection), not sequential claims of one operator (§4.1 role-note (c)) |
| Registration window / epoch cadence / setup window | Launch param (`PROVISIONAL`) | Open-operator market §4.1.1 / §4.1.2 | **Scheduling / economics values only** — this epoch's registration-window length, epoch cadence, exact bond amount within the policy-P bond **class**, and setup-window deadline for N-of-N presign completion (§4.1.2 item 5). These do **not** change `asset_id`. Identity-bound policy (join rule, bond class/tier, anti-domination predicate, KeyAgg+PoP, R-08 duty for gated deployments) lives in `operator_set_root` (§3.1 schema comment / §3.1.3) |

Mark every value **`PROVISIONAL` until BitVM2 launch-pin against live economics.**

### 4.5 No-council trade-off

This profile has **no** emergency multisig, **no** admin keys, and **no** in-place upgrade path for a live vault graph. Combined with NEW-01, the vault **presigning set is N-of-N** (not t-of-n) and there is **no live threshold signing path** that a current operator coalition could use to improvise vault spends: every vault movement is a pre-signed graph transaction whose setup keys are deleted.

**Consequence of a bug depends on its class.** A **non-soundness bug** (liveness / graph-construction / operational — e.g. a mis-wired connector or a stuck watchtower) under **1-of-N setup honesty and sound circuit/BitVM2 crypto**: affected deposits can irreversibly freeze (BitVM-family property: worst case is burn / freeze, not silent theft by a dishonest minority). A **critical soundness bug in the circuit itself or in the BitVM2 graph** is a **different failure class**: 1-of-N *setup* honesty is a key-custody assumption and does **not** cover circuit/crypto **soundness**, so such a bug **can enable actual vault theft** — consistent with the §5 "Reserve safety" row's **"sound BitVM2 crypto"** condition and its **"False claim reimburses thief"** failure mode. The pre-mainnet external audit gate (§4.6(B) maturity-gate audit item and the §4.5 "Required discipline" items below) exists **precisely** to close the circuit/graph-soundness class before mainnet. Without a Security Council, there is no trusted party that can sweep funds to a Safe Harbor. If `MoveToBacked` fires but the mint never settles, the backing-only vault is an **irrevocable, consented contribution to the shared reserve** (no cooperative refund, no depositor vault refund — R-01 / INV-01; may be consumed by another holder's cross-graph redeem — §4.2 / §3.3.2 / §3.4), not recoverable via a live multisig or depositor reclaim.

**Required discipline before mainnet:**

- §1.7.8-grade freeze discipline on the v2 circuit surface;
- differential testing of LCP and mint/redeem branches;
- external audit gate on the v2 circuit, BitVM2 stack, and **pre-signed** graphs **before** mainnet (including verification that setup signing shares are deleted and that no live `agg_key` CHECKSIG leaf remains on vault outputs);
- the §4.1 role-note (c) per-operator **sequencing connector** plus the §4.4 independent-watchtower floor close the one-shot weakness that a Payout Admin covers (graph structure, not an admin key).

**Upgrades:** new-vault migration only — new deposits into a new graph / new `vault_template` or new `operator_set_root` (new `asset_id` if those bound fields change); holders redeem-and-re-peg to move. Never in-place rotation of a live vault's admin keys or of a gatekeeper (gatekeeper rotation = new asset — §3.1). Efficiency upgrades (BitVM3/Glock/Mosaic — §10.1) are a verifier-trait swap + new vault graph (new epoch), not a token-standard change.

**Comparison:** Citrea's Security Council (3-of-5) **can** move funds in emergency / upgrade paths (report-citrea §4.2 / §4.4). This design refuses that trust root deliberately and pays for it with irreversibility.

### 4.6 Launch gates (normative)

Two blocking gate families. Both **MUST** clear before any public claim that a deployed asset is **zkBTC** under this specification.

#### (A) REQ-4 gates

Without these, the REQ-4 claim is **false** (a mint-time party re-enters on the safety or liveness axis of exit).

1. **Policy-P anti-domination (open registration market).** No single party **MUST** control ≥ half of any epoch's openly-registered operator set. Enforced economically by bond cost + honest-registration assumption; and, in gatekeeper mode, backstopped by the **R-08** operator-set-diversity vouch against a Sybil / self-controlled epoch (Attack B — §3.1.2 / §4.1.1). (R-04 remains the private-fork / Attack A backstop and is independent of this domination gate.) Bootstrap capture (one organisation == entire operator set of an epoch) reintroduces that party's control of exit liveness and, with collusion, safety edges — and would also make the 1-of-N honesty assumption vacuous (Part 2 / Attack B).
2. **Setup integrity (BitVM2 form).** For every dispute path, N-of-N presign ceremony integrity **MUST** hold, with the independent-watchtower/challenger floor met and the anti-grief ceremony rule of §4.1.2 item 5. Toxic-waste concern re-based to BitVM2: connector/presign correctness; one honest signer deletes (NEW-01). No single mint-time party **MUST** monopolise setup artefacts that would allow forging or voiding fraud proofs.  
   **Open point:** IF a global circuit-specific setup artifact also exists in the BitVM2 conversion path (to be verified as part of the Plonky2→BitVM2 work), the classic "MPC ceremony with independent contributors" gate **MUST** apply there too. Do not abstract this uncertainty away.
3. **Documented holder → operator onboarding** (self-fronting) via **open permissionless registration** (§4.1.1 / §4.1.2), acknowledging the bonded-onboarding cost of §4.1 role-note (b).
4. **Challenger economics documented.** Name deployed Clementine's self-funded-challenge gap (challengers must self-fund; cross-chain reimbursement not deployed — report-citrea) as the **anti-pattern** to solve. BitVM2 permissionless challenge still needs challenger incentive/funding — an honest open item (not an availability gap).

#### (B) Maturity / integration gates

Restatement of §4.0 as a checklist (two tracks — both **MUST** clear):

- [x] BitVM2 mainnet live (CLEARED — Bitlayer 2025-07; Citrea Clementine live 2026-01)
- [ ] Reference open-registration operator market operational (§4.1.1 / §4.1.2) — track (b)
- [ ] **Plonky2 → BitVM2 (Groth16/SNARK) conversion of the zkCoins compliance predicate demonstrated** — track (a)
- [ ] External audit of the v2 circuit, BitVM2 graph, and pre-signed graphs published (circuit/graph soundness — the class that can enable theft per §4.5 / §5)

## 5. Trust matrix

| Concern | What must hold | Who | Failure effect | Gatekeeper-dependent? |
|---------|----------------|-----|----------------|----------------------|
| **Reserve safety** | 1-of-N setup honesty (key deletion / correct presign); **permissionless challenge (BitVM2)** **plus ≥1 honest live challenger/watchtower actually acting within every relevant challenge window** (§5 residual 3; availability ≠ guaranteed action — §4.1 role-note (a)); per-operator sequencing connectors; ≥ floor independent watchtowers; sound BitVM2 crypto; `operator_set_root` **policy** honesty basis | Operators / watchtowers / setup | False claim reimburses thief; or vault frozen | **No** (if gates A hold) |
| **Mint integrity / canonicity** | TS3 clauses (a)–(h); LCP proves `MoveToBacked` at depth ≥ `D_mint` + N-of-N; recursive `operator_set_root` equality; **and** (gatekeeper mode) gatekeeper withholds `Pk_mint` until `MoveToBacked` **and** `reg_root_E` are confirmed on its **own canonical Bitcoin view** and the deposit is not refunded there (**R-04** / Attack A) **and** until the backing epoch's operator set has **at least one independent honest signer (1-of-N-honest basis)** (**R-08** / Attack B) | Minter + **gatekeeper as canonical-chain anchor** (`MoveToBacked` + `reg_root_E`) **and diversity vouch** when designated; depositor co-sign on `MoveToBacked` always (INV-01) | Unbacked mint; private-fork amortization mint (Attack A); self-controlled Sybil-epoch vault drain (Attack B); or (no-gk) non-canonical mint if operators reimburse it | **Yes for trust-minimized pooled canonicity + diversity** when designated (structurally load-bearing — R-04 **and** R-08; under open registration gatekeeper **integrity** is also a backing-safety dependency via R-08 — §6.3); structural legitimacy always via asset-bound `operator_set_root` (foreign-root only). **Corner C (no-gk + open-reg + pooled): UNSOUND** — see residual 9 / trilemma §3.2.1.2 |
| **Transfer** | Ordinary §2 soundness + nullifier first-occurrence | Protocol | Double-spend / invalid transfer rejected | **No** |
| **Redeem liveness** | ≥ 1 live liquid **registered** operator (open set §4.1.1); bonds / fees economic under `max_fee` | Operators | Exit stalls (ransom / freeze risk) | **No** |
| **Redeem safety** | Full §4.3.2 fraud statement; claim-marker uniqueness (logical first-marker); value preservation; permissionless BitVM2 challenge paths **plus ≥1 honest live challenger actually acting in-window** (if ≥1 challenger acts — §4.3.1; §5 residual 3) | Operators / challengers | Unbacked vault drain | **No** (if gates A hold) |
| **Entry quality** | Gatekeeper SoF + vault legitimacy vouch (when present); else structural only | Gatekeeper / none | Tainted mint waved through; or refusal / delay with refund leaf | **Yes** when designated (by design) |

**Residual assumptions (honest list):**

1. 1-of-N setup honesty (key-deletion style covenant emulation for presigned paths) over the **asset-bound, openly registered** operator set under policy P (`operator_set_root`).
2. ≥ 1 independent **registered** operator for exit liveness (open set — anyone may register, including the holder).
3. ≥ floor independent watchtowers (normative `PROVISIONAL` ≥ 3) **and** per-operator claim serialization (§4.1 role-note (c)) against the watchtower one-shot weakness; **and**, for reserve/redeem safety, **≥1 honest, live challenger/watchtower actually acting within every relevant challenge window** — not merely that a floor count exists or that challenge is permissionlessly available (mechanism-availability is delivered by BitVM2 — residual 6 / §4.1 role-note (a); safety requires actual action; else unchallenged-fraud drain — §3.6).
4. Bitcoin adversary below ~45–50% hashrate for the relevant challenge horizon (Clementine / whitepaper class bounds; report-citrea).
5. Deep-finality of `MoveToBacked` at depth ≥ `D_mint` on the proven LCP chain (§3.4); residual reorg deeper than `D_mint` is D-16 class. **Canonical binding** of that chain — for **both** `MoveToBacked` **and** `reg_root_E` — to the Bitcoin tip is **not** in-circuit alone: in gatekeeper mode it is the gatekeeper's mint-signing duty (R-04 extended).
6. **Permissionless challenging is DELIVERED under BitVM2** (not an open dependency — residual 3 / §4.1 role-note (a)); mechanism-availability alone does **not** guarantee safety. The residual beyond delivery is (i) that **≥1 honest challenger actually acts in-window** (residual 3) and (ii) challenger **incentive/funding** economics that make such action rational (§4.6A(4)).
7. When a gatekeeper is designated: gatekeeper liveness at mint time (quality filter, **canonical-chain anchor (R-04: `MoveToBacked` + `reg_root_E`)**, and **operator-set-diversity vouch (R-08)** — §6), including the gated `MoveToBacked` co-sign and withholding `Pk_mint` until canonical confirmation of both anchors **and** diversity. **Not** a custody dependency over circulating coins or exits; **is** load-bearing for trust-minimized mint canonicity and Attack-B defense; under open registration, gatekeeper **integrity** is also a **backing-safety dependency** via R-08 (§6.3).
8. **Consented irrevocable reserve contribution residual (R-01 / INV-01):** if `MoveToBacked` fires (with **depositor co-signature in both modes**, plus gatekeeper co-signature in gated mode) but the mint never settles, the backing-only vault BTC becomes an **irrevocable, consented contribution to the shared reserve** (cross-graph redeemable by other holders) — not merely frozen recoverable BTC (§3.3.2 / §3.4 / §4.2). Unilateral escape only pre-`MoveToBacked` via the deposit refund leaf.
9. **No-gatekeeper hard limitation (R-04 + R-08; sound-deployment trilemma §3.2.1.2):** without a gatekeeper (or equivalent canonical-oracle role), there is **no external canonical observer** at mint settlement for `MoveToBacked` or `reg_root_E` (**Attack A** **not cleanly closed** — R-04 absent; only operators-as-best-effort-oracle) and **no operator-set-diversity vouch** under open registration (**Attack B** **not closed** — R-08 absent). The economic anti-domination bond of policy P alone is **insufficient** against Attack B. **Closing the operator set does not close Attack A.** **Corner C** (no-gatekeeper + open permissionless registration + pooled cross-graph) is **UNSOUND** and **MUST NOT** be deployed or marketed as trust-minimized. **Corner B** (closed genesis-enumerated set + no gatekeeper + pooled) is **materially weaker (Attack A operator-oracle-only), not clean** — Attack B closed by genesis enumeration, but Attack A remains operator-oracle-weak; abandons open registration; distinct closed-enumeration policy. **There is no fully-clean no-gatekeeper profile for a pooled cross-graph reserve.** **Corner A** (open + pooled + gatekeeper) is the recommended zkBTC profile: a trust-minimized pooled cross-graph reserve **REQUIRES** a gatekeeper for R-04 **and** R-08 (REQ-3, §3.2.1.2, §6.4).
10. **Open-operator anti-domination residual:** policy P **MUST** prevent single-party epoch domination (§3.1.2 / §4.6A(1) / §4.1.1); otherwise a self-controlled epoch re-opens **Attack B**. Economic bond/stake enforcement is weaker than a genesis enumeration and **insufficient alone** under pooled cross-graph; gatekeeper mode backstops via **R-08** (operator-set-diversity vouch — not R-04).

## 6. Gatekeeper model and compliance

### 6.1 Why a gatekeeper

Without an entry filter, coins from a hack/theft or sanctioned sources could be minted into the shielded system and zkCoins abused for laundering. That harms **all** holders' fungibility, the token's reputation, and regulatory acceptance. The gatekeeper screens **source-of-funds** and **vault legitimacy** at entry.

**Additionally — and structurally load-bearing for pooled backing — three mint-time duties:**

1. **Source-of-funds / vault-legitimacy screening** (reputation / compliance surface).
2. **Canonical-chain anchor (R-04 / Attack A; covers `MoveToBacked` and `reg_root_E`).** The mint LCP proves `MoveToBacked` (and `reg_root_E`) confirmed at adequate depth on *some* header chain; nothing in-circuit alone binds that chain to the verifier's **canonical** Bitcoin view (§3.4). Because only the gatekeeper can produce the `Pk_mint` signature (`sk_mint = sk_gk + h`) that settles the mint, and the gatekeeper **withholds** that signature until it has verified on its **own canonical Bitcoin view** that (i) `MoveToBacked` is confirmed to depth ≥ `D_mint` on the canonical chain, (ii) the deposit was not refunded there, and (iii) `reg_root_E` is the canonical registration commitment for the epoch, a private-fork `MoveToBacked` or substituted `reg_root_E` yields no mint. A co-signed `MoveToBacked` alone is insufficient (setup signatures are valid on any fork).
3. **Operator-set-diversity vouch (R-08 / Attack B).** Under open permissionless registration the circuit cannot tell one party's N keys from N parties. The gatekeeper **MUST** refuse to sign a mint unless the backing epoch's operator set has **at least one independent honest signer (1-of-N-honest basis)** that will refuse a malicious graph — methodology is off-protocol identity/reputation vetting (§3.1.2 / §3.2.1.1). R-08 closes the self-controlled Sybil-epoch → cross-graph drain that R-04 does **not** address.

The gatekeeper's remit is therefore **all three** duties that make **trust-minimized pooled cross-graph backing** possible. This is why the gatekeeper is **structurally load-bearing**, not merely reputational.

Permissionless minting without any quality authority is still protocol-valid (no-gatekeeper mode) but — under open registration and pooled cross-graph reimbursement — is **UNSOUND** for trust-minimized pooled backing (Corner C of the sound-deployment trilemma — §3.2.1.2 / §6.4): structural deposit-backing and `operator_set_root` still prevent unbacked inflation and *foreign-root* self-controlled vaults under honest LCP use, yet there is no per-mint source-of-funds filter, no per-mint legitimacy/diversity vouch (**R-08** absent → Attack B open), and **no external canonical observer** for `MoveToBacked` or `reg_root_E` (**R-04** absent → Attack A open).

### 6.2 Whose interest

The gatekeeper represents the interests of the **asset's existing holders** — their coins' value and fungibility depend on the token not becoming a laundering vehicle. A holder-committee threshold key (MuSig2/FROST aggregate; still a single x-only key in-circuit) operationalises "represents holders." **Threshold / FROST is allowed only for the gatekeeper key** (approval liveness; cannot create unbacked mints **when performing R-04/R-08 honestly**; a compromised gatekeeper can (Attack A/B — §2.1/§6.3)). The vault **presigning / operator set MUST be N-of-N** (NEW-01 — §2.1): one honest share deletion is what delivers 1-of-N setup safety; a `t < N` operator threshold would leave `N−1 ≥ t` shares able to sign after one honest deletion. For the **gatekeeper**, N-of-N is discouraged (loss of a single member key permanently disables minting; rotation = new asset); threshold (t-of-n) for the gatekeeper is **RECOMMENDED** (§2.1).

### 6.3 What the gatekeeper is NOT (the guarantee)

The gatekeeper gates **ENTRY (new mints) only**. Mechanism for each non-power:

| Claimed abuse | Why it fails |
|---------------|--------------|
| Freeze circulating coins | No gatekeeper role in §2 holder transitions |
| Claw back settled mints or transfers | No protocol clawback; coins are ordinary §2 state |
| Block transfers | Same as freeze — no gatekeeper clause |
| Block redemptions | No gatekeeper role in §4.3 peg-out; REQ-4 |
| Mint unbacked supply | Deposit-backing clauses (e)/(f)/(h); LCP + amount discipline; gated mode also withholds `Pk_mint` until **canonical** `MoveToBacked` **and** `reg_root_E` (R-04 / Attack A) **and** until operator-set diversity holds (R-08 / Attack B) — **provided the gatekeeper performs R-04/R-08 honestly**; a compromised gatekeeper that skips them can enable Attack A/B (§6.3) |
| Redirect a mint | Clause (g) recipient binding |
| Double-mint one deposit | First-occurrence on deterministic `Pk_mint` |
| Inflate beyond real deposits | Same deposit-backing + uniqueness (mint-time 1:1 to a real deposit; **post-mint** backing integrity is conditional — §3.6 / §5) |
| Add/remove/rotate itself in place | `gatekeeper` frozen in `asset_id`; rotation = new asset |
| Directly forge a vault spend / steal circulating coins | No gatekeeper key on vault spends; N-of-N presigned graphs; no clawback of circulating coins |

A **compromised / negligent** gatekeeper **cannot** directly forge a vault spend, touch circulating coins, freeze, or block exit (REQ-4 intact). **But** under open registration it **can enable Attack B** by skipping the R-08 diversity vouch and waving through a Sybil-controlled epoch's mint — which drains honest holders' backing via the normal redeem/front path: **economically equivalent to theft of backing**, though effected through the protocol's redeem path rather than a forged signature. Skipping the R-04 canonical-chain check (on `MoveToBacked` or `reg_root_E`) re-opens Attack A. Burning a `Pk_mint` slot remains the benign failure mode. Therefore, under open registration, **gatekeeper INTEGRITY (not merely liveness) is a backing-SAFETY dependency** via R-08 — a real trust concentration, distinct from custody over circulating coins or exits. **Mitigation (do not overstate):** the gatekeeper **MAY** be a threshold/committee aggregate (already allowed, §2.1) and its R-08 vetting **SHOULD** be as transparent/auditable as possible; this distributes the dependency, it does not remove it. So a gatekeeper is a **mint-time liveness dependency**, a **canonicity / diversity / entry-integrity dependency**, and under open registration a **backing-safety dependency via R-08** — never a custody dependency over circulating coins or redemptions.

### 6.4 Trade-off (honest) and security classes

| Class | Gatekeeper | Operator-set binding | Source-of-funds filter | Canonical-chain anchor (R-04 / Attack A) | Operator-set-diversity vouch (R-08 / Attack B) | Mint-time liveness + backing-safety dependence |
|-------|------------|----------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Gatekeeper-gated zkBTC (Corner A)** | Present (`gatekeeper ≠ 0³²`) | `operator_set_root` in `asset_id` + per-mint legitimacy vouch | Yes (gatekeeper remit) | **Yes** — gatekeeper withholds `Pk_mint` until canonical `MoveToBacked` **and** `reg_root_E` confirmation (§3.2.1.1 / §4.1.2) | **Yes** — gatekeeper withholds `Pk_mint` unless backing epoch has **≥1 independent honest signer (1-of-N-honest basis)** (§3.1.2 / §3.2.1.1) | Yes (gatekeeper must be online/willing after canonical + diversity checks); under open registration **integrity** is also a **backing-safety dependency** via R-08 (§6.3) |
| **No-gatekeeper + closed enumerated set (Corner B)** | Absent (`0³²`) | Genesis-enumerated set + gate A(1) diversity at launch; `operator_set_root` commits a **closed enumeration** policy P′ (distinct from open default) | No | **No external observer** — Attack A only **operator-oracle-weak** (closing the set does **not** close Attack A) | Diversity guaranteed at genesis enumeration (closes Attack B; not open reg) | No gatekeeper dependence; **materially weaker (Attack A operator-oracle-only), not clean**; abandons open registration |
| **No-gatekeeper + open registration + pooled (Corner C)** | Absent (`0³²`) | `operator_set_root` open policy **only** (structural; foreign-root only) | No | **No external observer** — Attack A **not closed** (operator-oracle-only) | **No** diversity vouch — Attack B **not closed** | **UNSOUND** — forbidden for trust-minimized pooled marketing |

A gatekeeper adds mint-time liveness dependence in exchange for reputation assurance **and** for the **two** structurally load-bearing mint duties that make trust-minimized pooled cross-graph backing possible: R-04 (canonical anchor for `MoveToBacked` **and** `reg_root_E` / Attack A) and R-08 (operator-set-diversity vouch / Attack B; under open registration, **integrity** is a backing-safety dependency — §6.3). A no-gatekeeper token has no such dependence but no entry filter and **no external canonical observer**; under open registration it also has **no diversity vouch**.

**Prominent limitation (MUST state — sound-deployment trilemma §3.2.1.2; R-04 + R-08).** A **trust-minimized pooled cross-graph zkBTC REQUIRES a gatekeeper (or an equivalent external canonical+diversity oracle)** for **both** independent drain attacks: R-04 closes Attack A cleanly (including `reg_root_E` canonicity); R-08 closes Attack B under open registration. **There is no fully-clean no-gatekeeper profile for a pooled cross-graph reserve.** **Corner C** (no-gatekeeper + open permissionless registration + pooled cross-graph) is **UNSOUND** and **MUST NOT** be presented as trust-minimized pooled backing — no constructible in-protocol escape. **Corner A** (open + pooled + gatekeeper) is the recommended product. **Corner B** (closed genesis-enumerated set + no gatekeeper + pooled) is **materially weaker (Attack A operator-oracle-only), not clean** — Attack B closed by genesis enumeration, but Attack A remains operator-oracle-weak; abandons open registration; distinct closed-enumeration policy — **not** a trust-minimized peer of Corner A. The product requirement (open operators + pooled fungible) **forces Corner A**. The gatekeeper is **structurally load-bearing**, not merely reputational.

**Ship condition for no-gatekeeper mode.** A no-gatekeeper zkBTC **MUST NOT** be shipped as open registration + pooled (**Corner C** is **UNSOUND**). The only non-forbidden no-gatekeeper pooled profile is **Corner B**: closed genesis-enumerated operator set with gate-A(1) diversity at launch, with `operator_set_root` committing that **closed enumeration** policy (distinct asset from the open default) — and even Corner B is **materially weaker (Attack A operator-oracle-only), not clean**, not open-operator, and **MUST NOT** be marketed as equal to gatekeeper-gated Corner A or as trust-minimized open-registration pooled cross-graph backing. The market chooses.

### 6.5 Competing deployments

Restatement of §2.5: because `gatekeeper` and `operator_set_root` (and `H(vault_template)`) are bound into `asset_id`, each combination is a distinct asset. Anyone can deploy a competing zkBTC with their own or no gatekeeper; wallets key by `asset_id`; adoption decides which wins.

### 6.6 Compliance surface summary

**REQ-3 rationale.** Optional gatekeeper approval at mint prevents (when designated) wash-in of tainted BTC while keeping issuance permissionless for minters, **and** supplies the **three load-bearing mint-time duties** without which trust-minimized pooled cross-graph backing is not achieved: (1) source-of-funds / vault-legitimacy screening, (2) the **canonical-chain anchor** (R-04 / Attack A: covers `MoveToBacked` **and** `reg_root_E`), and (3) the **operator-set-diversity vouch** (R-08 / Attack B; under open registration, integrity is a backing-safety dependency — §6.3) (§6.1 / §6.4). Minting economic activity and gatekeeping remain separate roles. A gatekeeper (or equivalent external canonical+diversity oracle) is **required** for a trust-minimized pooled cross-graph zkBTC (**Corner A** of the sound-deployment trilemma — §3.2.1.2): there is **no fully-clean no-gatekeeper pooled profile**. No-gatekeeper + open registration + pooled is **Corner C / UNSOUND**. No-gatekeeper + closed enumerated set (**Corner B**) remains protocol-valid only under the §6.4 ship restrictions and is **materially weaker (Attack A operator-oracle-only), not clean** — **MUST NOT** be marketed as equal to Corner A or as trust-minimized open-registration pooled cross-graph backing.

**REQ-2 and REQ-4 are deliberate.** The gatekeeper **MUST NOT** be able to freeze or claw back circulating zkBTC, and **MUST NOT** be able to block a redemption. Flip side (state plainly): exits of later-sanctioned holders **cannot** be stopped either. Compliance that needs continuous transaction-level freeze would require a different product (not this one).

**What compliance retains (gatekeeper-gated assets):**

- **L1 surface:** every payout's `btc_recipient` is a public Bitcoin output; deposit provenance is screened at entry.
- **Entry refusal:** gatekeeper may refuse new mints (depositor reclaims via refund).

**What compliance does not get:**

- No transaction-level gatekeeper visibility inside the shielded zone (privacy holds for internal transfers).
- No gatekeeper veto on transfers or redemptions.

| Surface | Visible to gatekeeper / compliance function | Mechanism |
|---------|---------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Deposit UTXO | Yes (public Bitcoin) | L1 |
| Source-of-funds / KYC | Yes when gatekeeper process requires it (off-protocol) | Off-protocol |
| Mint recipient address | Bound in deposit commitment; mint goes only to that recipient | Clause (g) |
| Vault legitimacy | Gatekeeper vouch (gated) + in-circuit `operator_set_root` | §3.2 / §3.3(e) |
| Operator-set diversity at mint | Gatekeeper R-08 1-of-N-honest / party-diversity vouch (gated; withholds `Pk_mint` if Sybil epoch; integrity = backing-safety dependency under open reg — §6.3) | §3.1.2 / §3.2.1.1 / R-08 |
| Canonical `MoveToBacked` + `reg_root_E` at mint | Gatekeeper's own canonical Bitcoin view (gated; withholds `Pk_mint` until both anchors confirmed) | §3.2.1.1 / §4.1.2 / R-04 |
| Internal transfers | No | Shielded §2 |
| Redeem request | No (unless gatekeeper is also chosen operator) | Off-chain to operators |
| Payout UTXO | Yes (public Bitcoin) | L1 |

### 6.7 Designed non-properties

State these so product and legal review do not invent protocol powers that do not exist:

1. **No freeze list** for circulating coins.
2. **No clawback** of settled mints or transfers.
3. **No gatekeeper signature** on redeem or payout.
4. **No selective mint redirect** after deposit (clause (g)).
5. **No in-place gatekeeper rotation** (new asset only).

---

## 7. What minters and the gatekeeper can and cannot do

### 7.1 Minter CAN

- **Deposit and request a mint** to a committed recipient (permissionless economic role).
- **Hold the minted coin** (or have it delivered to the committed recipient) and transfer freely (REQ-2).
- **Redeem** without gatekeeper cooperation (REQ-4).

### 7.2 Gatekeeper CAN (when designated)

- **Refuse / approve mints** at entry (source-of-funds + vault legitimacy + **R-08** operator-set-diversity vouch + **R-04** canonical-chain confirmation).
- **See deposit provenance** on L1 and any off-protocol KYC data it requires; perform off-protocol identity/reputation vetting of epoch registrants for R-08.
- **Hold and manage `sk_gk`** under its key-management policy (including as a threshold aggregate).

**Key-management properties (normative analysis):**

- **Loss of `sk_gk`:** no **new** mints of this asset ever. Existing circulating supply and redemptions are **unaffected** (redemptions do not use `sk_gk`). For an **N-of-N** gatekeeper aggregate, loss of **any single** member key has the same permanent effect — threshold (t-of-n) is **RECOMMENDED** (§2.1 / GK-6).
- **Theft of `sk_gk`:** thief can approve mints for **future** deposits (derive `sk_mint`, settle TS3 mints). Clause (g) recipient binding still prevents redirecting already-committed deposits, and the thief **cannot** forge a vault spend, touch circulating coins, freeze, or block exit (REQ-4 intact). **When the thief performs R-04/R-08 honestly**, circuit deposit-backing clauses still require a real vault output of matching amount — the thief cannot mint against pure fiction or redirect committed recipients. **But a thief with `sk_gk` can skip R-04 and R-08** and thereby **enable Attack A** (private-fork mint) and **Attack B** (Sybil-epoch mint) → **backing drain** via the normal redeem path, even though it cannot forge a vault spend or redirect a committed deposit. **Worst realistic abuse:** enabling Attack A/B (backing drain — integrity is a backing-safety dependency under open registration, §6.3), censorship / denial of service at entry, waving through tainted mints (reputation filter bypassed), and burning slots by blind-signing garbage (signing without checking inputs — §3.2.1.1).

### 7.3 CANNOT (gatekeeper and minter)

- **Mint without a fresh real `MoveToBacked` backing-only vault output** of matching amount under N-of-N and in-set `agg_key` — clauses (e), (f), (h).
- **Redirect a mint** — clause (g).
- **Mint twice per vault outpoint** — clause (f) + first-occurrence on `Pk_mint`.
- **Block transfers** — no gatekeeper/minter role in §2 holder transitions.
- **Block / censor redemptions** — no gatekeeper role in §4.3.
- **Inflate supply beyond the vault UTXO ceiling** — §3.6 conditional upper-bound auditability (**conditional on the reserve-safety assumptions of §5**: 1-of-N setup honesty + R-04 + R-08/genesis + ≥1 honest challenger; a successful **Attack A**, **Attack B**, **or** unchallenged fraudulent/duplicate reimbursement breaks it).
- **Seize the vault unilaterally** — no unilateral vault path; spends only along presigned graphs.
- **Substitute a self-controlled operator set under this asset** — recursive `operator_set_root` membership closes the *foreign-root* substitution; under open registration, closing **Attack B** (self-controlled *in-set* vault under the correct root) additionally requires the gated-mode **R-08** operator-set-diversity vouch. In no-gatekeeper open-registration mode Attack B is **not closed** (§3.1.2 / §3.2.1.2 / §6.4).

## 8. Privacy implications

Port of BITVM_BRIDGE.md §9, specialised for TS3.

### 8.1 Peg-in observability

The user's deposit on Bitcoin L1 is visible. Observers of the vault see:

- deposit amount (denomination-quantised);
- funding addresses;
- vault-move timing;
- temporal correlation with the subsequent mint nullifier inscription (vaulted amounts are public on L1; exact mint↔deposit linkage for third parties still requires the mint proof or a published attestation ledger — §3.6).

This is a privacy regression versus a pure off-chain mint, and a privacy improvement versus holding L1 BTC for all subsequent activity (internal transfers are shielded).

### 8.2 Peg-out observability (honest — NH-04)

Symmetric: `btc_recipient` is a public P2TR output; temporal correlation of redeem nullifier time with payout time is observable. `redeem_commitment` keeps redemption **details** off the public ProofData opening — only the bridge sees openings until claim time.

**Indistinguishability bound (MUST state honestly).** A redeem transition is on-chain indistinguishable from any other transition **only until the operator's reimbursement claim marker appears**. The claim marker then links that redeem (`(Pkᵢ, Rᵢ)`) to its payout outpoint. Redemption correlates on-chain anyway (public payout); this is an **accepted privacy boundary**, not a failure of the hiding commitment. Redeem-branch amounts and openings remain **recursion-only** for the reimbursement circuit (§4.3.2 exposition note; §3.7.2) and **MUST NOT** appear as on-chain public inputs of `C`.

### 8.3 Internal transfers

Unaffected: global anonymity set of shielded multi-asset transfers; gatekeeper and operators learn nothing about non-bridged traffic beyond what separate hosting roles already expose.

### 8.4 Mitigations

- Fresh L1 addresses per deposit and per payout.
- Holder-side timing discretion between mint and first transfer, and between redeem and requesting payout.
- Optional coinjoin after payout.
- Hiding recipient commitment on deposit (already normative in §3.3(g)) so operators see commitment, not plaintext, until mint delivery.

**Analogy:** Zcash t-address / z-address model — transparent edges, shielded interior. zkCoins-with-bridge has **less** privacy than zkCoins-without-bridge (L1 touch points) but keeps private interior transfers.

---

## 9. Transitional profile (NOT zkBTC)

Until the TS3 circuit and the BitVM2 integration gate (Plonky2→BitVM2 conversion) clear, an operator **MAY** run a custodial-window bridged BTC asset **today** under token standard 1 plus an operator service, following the lightning-bridge.md pattern:

- operator SLA for redemption (quote / burn-address or §5.6-link style proof of payment to a sink);
- mint policy matching observed L1 locks under operator honesty;
- no new wire protocol; ordinary sender/recipient roles.

### 9.1 Naming lock (normative)

Such an asset:

- **MUST** use its own asset name and `asset_id`;
- **MUST NEVER** use the name **"zkBTC"**;
- **MUST** carry the banner: *does not meet REQ-4 — redemption is an operator SLA, supply is operator-attested*;
- **MUST NOT** promise migration into zkBTC (different asset, different lineage universe).

### 9.2 What the transitional profile lacks vs TS3

| Property | Transitional (TS1 + SLA) | zkBTC (TS3 + BitVM2) |
|----------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Supply audit | Operator-attested; amounts unobservable | Conditional upper bound vs public vault UTXOs (**conditional on the reserve-safety assumptions of §5**: 1-of-N + R-04 + R-08/genesis + ≥1 honest challenger — broken by Attack A, Attack B, **or** unchallenged fraudulent reimbursement); exact via optional aggregate attestation (§3.6) |
| Mint bound to vault outpoint | Policy only | In-circuit LCP (N-of-N + deep finality + operator-set) + `Pk_mint` |
| Redeem | Operator SLA | Bridge claim keyed on `(Pkᵢ, Rᵢ)` |
| Gatekeeper on exit path | N/A (often SLA counterparty = operator) | No |
| Name | Must not be "zkBTC" | "zkBTC" reserved for this profile |
| Migration promise | Forbidden | N/A |

Discovery, if any, **SHOULD** use a distinct operator `features` flag (not the reserved zkBTC product name) and fail closed when absent — same spirit as lightning-bridge discovery.

---

## 10. Future upgrade paths

Two clearly labeled tracks. Neither is a launch dependency.

### 10.1 Efficiency upgrades (NOT soft-fork; 1-of-N structure family)

**BitVM3 / Mosaic / Argo** reduce on-chain dispute cost ~1000× relative to BitVM2 → **lower minimum denominations**, cheaper operator bonds, cheaper open registration. These preserve BitVM2's **permissionless challenge** structure and therefore the **same trust model** (only cheaper). Adopting them is a **verifier-trait swap + new vault graph (new epoch)**, not a token-standard change.

**Glock** also reduces dispute cost (~single-signature-scale disprove) but **reintroduces a designated-verifier challenge trade-off** — a genuine **trust-model change**, **not** "same trust model" as BitVM2. Unlike BitVM2 (and unlike BitVM3/Mosaic/Argo where they preserve open challenge), Glock's challenge is designated-verifier rather than permissionless (§4.1 role-note (a)). Adopt Glock **only** with that caveat explicitly acknowledged.

| Construction | Role | Sources |
|--------------|------|---------|
| Glock | Efficiency upgrade: ~single-signature-scale disprove; **designated-verifier trade-off** (trust-model change vs BitVM2) | eprint 2025/1485 |
| BitVM3 | Efficiency upgrade: dramatically cheaper disputes; permissionless challenge preserved | `bitvm.org/bitvm3.pdf`; eprint 2026/933 |
| Mosaic | Efficiency upgrade (Glock final piece class) | eprint 2026/812 |
| Argo | Related Ideal-Group / author-cluster research | eprint 2026/049 |

State plainly: these are **not** launch blockers. BitVM2 is the works-today normative verifier; efficiency upgrades land when mainnet-proven and economically beneficial — BitVM3/Mosaic/Argo as same-trust-model efficiency upgrades; Glock only with the designated-verifier caveat.

### 10.2 Covenant soft-fork upgrades (registration-free unilateral exit)

Covenant soft forks (OP_CTV / CSFS / OP_CAT class) would allow an anyone-can-satisfy exit script of the form "valid burn / redeem proof → fixed payout template," removing the operator-liveness residual **and** enabling **registration-free** self-reclaim by a passive holder who never registered. Alpen engineer analysis notes that without covenants, BitVM-style bridges remain operator-mediated via presigned graphs; with CAT+CTV-style tools, unilateral trustless withdraws become designable. None of these opcodes is activated on Bitcoin mainnet as of mid-2026; realistic timeline is multi-year and uncertain (landscape report §2.11; bitcoinops covenant topics).

**Witness-encryption / PIPEs v2** is a research-only soft-fork-free theoretical path toward registration-free reclaim (not product-ready; eprint 2026/186).

**Design consequence now:** the redeem statement (§3.5) is construction-agnostic — a hiding commitment plus an anchored ID `(Pkᵢ, Rᵢ)` — so **both** upgrade tracks **MAY** consume the **same** statement without rewriting the token standard. This document does not promise activation dates or claim that covenants are near.

## 11. Open questions

1. **Plonky2 → BitVM2 (Groth16/SNARK) conversion** of the zkCoins compliance predicate — **headline blocking integration gate**; needs engineering work against BitVM2/Clementine reference deployments.
2. **Global circuit-specific setup artifact in the conversion path?** Open point for launch gate A(2); verify against BitVM2 bridge materials and conversion work.
3. **Exact operator bond and challenge economics under BitVM2** once launch-pinned against live Clementine/Bitlayer economics (Clementine ~2 BTC bond class; BitVM2 multi-MB dispute cost ~$16k class).
4. **Challenger incentive/funding economics** under permissionless BitVM2 challenge (§4.6A(4)) — availability is delivered; funding remains an open item (Clementine self-funded-challenge gap as anti-pattern).
5. **Watchtower-count floor calibration** (current `PROVISIONAL` ≥ 3) together with sequencing-connector graph structure against one-shot weakness without a Payout Administrator.
6. **LCP checkpoint governance and `D_mint` / `S` calibration.** Proposal: the v2 circuit release **pins** the checkpoint, `D_mint`, and optional `S` (§3.7.2); advancing any is a circuit-parameter release (new digests), not a live governance function. There is **no** freshness window `W`.
7. **Denominations final set** after BitVM2 launch-pin economics (including whether/when 0.01 unlocks under §10.1 efficiency upgrades).
8. **Vault key / epoch rotation across deposit generations** without an admin path (new vault / new descriptor / new epoch registration / migration only; policy change = new `operator_set_root` = new asset).
9. **DoS on gatekeeper entry** (mass junk deposit/mint requests) — rate limits and fee policy are gatekeeper operational concerns, not circuit rules.
10. **Interaction with Lightning / Arkade swap layers.** Liquidity rails on top of circulating zkBTC; `ARKADE_INTEGRATION.md` and `LIGHTNING_ATOMIC_SWAP.md` remain unaffected complements (inventory swaps, not reserve proofs).
11. **Open-registration policy-P encoding (concrete bytes launch-pinned).** Semantic requirements for the open-registration policy root, bond class, admissibility predicate (anti-domination), KeyAgg+PoP, and Merkle/policy tree for membership proofs are specified in **§4.1.2** (with two-level admission normative in §3.1.2). Canonicity of `reg_root_E` is a **gatekeeper R-04 duty** (not an in-circuit claim — same LCP limit as `MoveToBacked`); completeness of the registered set is a **liveness residual**, not safety (Attack-B safety = R-08). Remaining open: concrete byte encoding / launch-pin of the policy tree and registration-output scripts (frozen with v2 digests, NEW-03 style); bond **magnitude** calibration vs live economics overlaps item 12.
12. **Anti-domination bond calibration** — bond cost high enough that single-party ≥ half of an epoch is economically irrational, without making open registration inaccessible (economic calibration; R-08 is the gated-mode Attack-B backstop — §3.1.2).
13. **Registration-window / epoch-cadence / setup-window parameters (calibration).** Semantic formation of `reg_root_E` (bond, PoP, Merkle commitment, KeyAgg, bounded restart rounds on exclusion, two-level ceremony Level 1/2 — §4.1.2) is specified; concrete `reg_root_E` commitment encoding is launch-pinned. Canonicity-of-`reg_root_E` is gatekeeper R-04 (not in-circuit). Remaining open: registration-window length, epoch-cadence tuning, and setup-window deadline calibration against live BitVM2 ceremony re-presign cost.

## 13. Change log

| Date | Change |
|------|--------|
| 2026-08-06 | Initial specification: TS3 (`issuance_version == 3`) + Glock-based zkBTC bridge profile; supersedes BRIDGE_MVP §4/§6.3 ProofType sketches and `IssuanceTerms_v2_glock_bridged` naming. |
| 2026-08-06 | Hardening: closed B-01..B-07, M-01..M-04 from the pre-freeze review — vault-outpoint mint + N-of-N + `D_mint`/`S` CSV window; `vault_template`/`instantiate`; full 7+ claim-consumed reimbursement statement; sequencing connectors; `max_fee`; bit-defined deposit key; pinned v2 surface (224-byte ProofData); `refund_timelock` out of terms; upper-bound supply audit; citation integrity via `bitvm-bridge-research.md`. |
| 2026-08-06 | Gatekeeper redesign: replace single issuer with optional per-token gatekeeper + operator-set-root legitimacy binding; close B-01/B-02/M-01/M-02/M-04/NH-01..04. |
| 2026-08-06 | Executability pass: close R-01 (NUMS vault taproot), R-02 (recursive operator_set_root binding), R-03 (gatekeeper input-verify-then-sign), R-04 (host-side freshness + strict boundary), R-05 (logical payout claim-marker), R-06/R-07. |
| 2026-08-06 | construction pass: R-01 (refund off vault output), R-04 (tip_height in ProofData_v2), NEW-01 (pre-signed-graph vault spend, no live CHECKSIG), NEW-02 (claimant-funded payout + slashed-marker exclusion), NEW-03 (canonical taproot + NUMS / honest launch-pin). |
| 2026-08-06 | mint↔vault binding inverted (MoveToBacked): mint proves MoveToBacked confirmation in-circuit; host-side freshness/tip_height/W removed; N-of-N presigning (threshold gatekeeper only); claim value-accounting; frozen-vault residual documented |
| 2026-08-06 | canonical-anchor pass: gatekeeper withholds the mint signature until canonical MoveToBacked confirmation (closes R-04 in gatekeeper mode); no-gatekeeper pooled backing documented as fundamentally weaker (no canonical observer); MoveToBacked-without-mint reframed as consented irrevocable reserve contribution with mandatory depositor co-signature (INV-01) |
| 2026-08-06 | Works-today rebase: normative verifier Glock→**BitVM2** (mainnet-proven; permissionless challenge delivered); added **open permissionless operator-registration market** (§4.1.1) with `operator_set_root` reframed as an open-registration **policy** (two-level epoch admission, §3.1.2); maturity gate collapses to Plonky2→BitVM2 conversion; §10 split into efficiency (Glock/BitVM3) vs covenant (registration-free exit) upgrade tracks; denomination/bond economics re-based on BitVM2; all prior hardening (INV-01, R-01..04, NEW-01..03, NH-01..04, M-01..04) preserved. |
| 2026-08-06 | Round-1 review hardening (codex DO-NOT-SHIP → SHIP): specified the open-registration mechanism (§4.1.2: bond/PoP/`reg_root_E`/MuSig2 KeyAgg/anti-grief ceremony); split Attack A (R-04 canonical anchor) from **Attack B (R-08 gatekeeper operator-set-diversity vouch)**; stated no-gatekeeper open-registration pooled cross-graph as **unsound** (not merely weaker); resolved `operator_set_root`↔§4.4 identity/parameter split; corrected §10.1 Glock trust-model wording and the 'one remaining gate' overclaim. |
| 2026-08-06 | Round-2 review hardening (codex round-2 DO-NOT-SHIP → SHIP): `reg_root_E` canonicity moved from in-circuit to gatekeeper anchor (R-04 extended) + completeness reframed as liveness (safety = R-08); replaced unconstructible no-gatekeeper same-epoch escape with the sound-deployment **trilemma** (open registration / no gatekeeper / pooled cross-graph — pick ≤2; Corner A = zkBTC, Corner C = UNSOUND); specified ceremony restart rounds + two-level (epoch-set / per-deposit) architecture with griefing routed to slash or deposit-refund; corrected compromised-gatekeeper never-steal overclaim (integrity is a backing-safety dependency under open registration); made the supply ceiling conditional on setup honesty; fixed honest-majority→1-of-N terminology. |
| 2026-08-06 | Round-3 review hardening (codex round-3 DO-NOT-SHIP → SHIP): corrected the trilemma — no-gatekeeper + closed-enumerated + pooled is **materially weaker (Attack A operator-oracle-only), not 'sound'** (closing the operator set does not close the private-fork attack); restated the honest two-attack decomposition (A = R-04 canonical anchor; B = R-08 / genesis enumeration) and that a trust-minimized pooled cross-graph reserve REQUIRES a gatekeeper for BOTH; fixed ceremony round-deadline-vs-window and systematic-Level-2→Level-1 escalation; propagated compromised-gatekeeper integrity caveat to §2.1/§7.2; added R-04 as a supply-ceiling condition in §3.6/§2.4/§9.2. |
| 2026-08-06 | Round-4 review hardening (codex round-4 DO-NOT-SHIP → SHIP): propagated the compromised-gatekeeper integrity caveat to the two threshold sites (§2.1/§6.2 'cannot create unbacked mints' now qualified); completed the supply-ceiling condition with the third drain vector (unchallenged fraudulent/duplicate reimbursement — §4.3.1/§5) at all restatement sites (§2.4/§3.6/§7.3/§9.2); added default-profile qualifiers for the closed-enumeration policy P′ at §2.5/Appendix B; fixed the three remaining honest-majority→1-of-N terminology sites. |
| 2026-08-06 | Round-5 review hardening (codex round-5 DO-NOT-SHIP → SHIP): comprehensive consistency sweep — conditioned every 'operators cannot steal / never theft' claim on 1-of-N + ≥1 honest live challenger acting in-window (BitVM2 optimistic assumption; else unchallenged-fraud drain — §3.6), with an explicit active-challenger residual in §5 and the availability-≠-action distinction stated once; propagated the honest-gatekeeper qualifier to the two missed table rows (§2.2/§6.3 'forge/mint unbacked supply'). |
| 2026-08-06 | Round-6 review hardening (codex round-6 DO-NOT-SHIP → SHIP): resolved the §4.5-vs-§5 self-contradiction — a critical **soundness** bug in the circuit / BitVM2 graph can enable theft (per §5 'sound BitVM2 crypto' condition), distinct from a non-soundness bug's freeze/burn under 1-of-N; the pre-mainnet audit gate (§4.6) closes the soundness class. |

| D2 | Mint-key derivation (`Pk_mint`; gatekeeper- vs depositor-base; MintKey domain; mod-n / even-y M-01) + mint consumes `Pk_mint` on **`MoveToBacked` vault** outpoint; gatekeeper verifies inputs **and own canonical Bitcoin view** then signs (not full proof); withholds until canonical `MoveToBacked` **and** `reg_root_E` (R-04 / Attack A) **and** until 1-of-N-honest operator-set diversity holds (R-08 / Attack B) | §3.2, §3.2.1.1, §4.1.2 |
| D3 | In-circuit mint clauses (a)–(h) incl. LCP: `MoveToBacked` vault outpoint, N-of-N witness, `C_lcp.operator_set_root == IssuanceTerms_v3.operator_set_root` (policy-root equality; two-level admission; `reg_root_E`/`agg_key_E` formation §4.1.2 — in-circuit PoW-depth only; canonicity = gatekeeper R-04; completeness = liveness residual), depth ≥ `D_mint`, instance byte-equality; **no** host-side freshness / `tip_height` / `W`; emission without self-credit; depositor co-sign on `MoveToBacked` both modes (INV-01) | §3.3, §3.3.1–§3.3.2, §4.1.2 |
| D4 | Deep-finality + gatekeeper canonical-chain anchor for `MoveToBacked` **and** `reg_root_E` (R-04 / Attack A) + operator-set-diversity vouch (R-08 / Attack B; 1-of-N-honest); no transitive downstream re-check; optional first-recipient SHOULD; consented irrevocable reserve contribution residual (INV-01) | §3.4, §4.2, §4.1.2 |
| D5 | Redeem: `redeem_commitment` incl. `max_fee < redeem_amount`, redeem ID `:= (Pkᵢ, Rᵢ)`, claim-marker uniqueness (logical first-marker on valid unchallenged set; slashed excluded; claimant-funded payout by **value-accounting**), value preservation (exactly `redeem_amount` from vault), payout ≥ `redeem_amount − max_fee` | §3.5, §4.3.2 |
| D6 | ProofData layout v2 (7 fields / **224 bytes**: six v1 + `redeem_commitment`; zero-sentinel for mint) + PI limbs + **`C_balance` re-pinned for v2** + `genesis_tag` + LCP pins (`D_mint`, optional `S`) + migration / coexistence | §3.5.2, §3.7, §3.7.2 |
| D7 | Bridge parameter table (`D_mint`, optional `S`, BitVM2 assert/challenge/disprove CSV, NUMS vault internal key, deposit-taproot-only refund, pre-signed `MoveToBacked` + backing-only vault, N-of-N presigning, watchtower floor, registration window / epoch cadence) vs Clementine / BitVM2 baselines | §4.4 |
| D8 | Roles (minter / optional gatekeeper / operators; vault presigning **MUST** N-of-N; FROST/threshold **MAY only for gatekeeper**; N-of-N gatekeeper loss warning) + sequencing connectors + launch gates (policy-P anti-domination, BitVM2 setup integrity, open registration onboarding, challenger economics) + gatekeeper three mint duties (SoF, R-04 covering `MoveToBacked`+`reg_root_E`, R-08) + gatekeeper integrity as backing-safety dependency under open reg (§6.3) | §2.1, §4.1, §4.1.1–§4.1.2, §4.6, §6 |
| D9 | Trust matrix + residual ≥1 **registered** operator + consented irrevocable contribution residual (INV-01) + sound-deployment **trilemma** (Corner A recommended / Corner B **materially weaker** Attack-A operator-oracle-only / Corner C **UNSOUND**; no fully-clean no-gatekeeper pooled profile) + efficiency/covenant upgrade paths + no-council consequence (graph-level one-shot close) + gatekeeper mint-time liveness + canonicity + diversity + open-reg backing-safety via R-08 | §5, §3.2.1.2, §4.5, §6, §10 |
| D10 | Transitional profile: own name/id, SLA shape, "does not meet REQ-4" banner, NEVER "zkBTC" | §9 |
| D11 | Gatekeeper model: reputation + **canonical-chain anchor** (R-04 / Attack A: `MoveToBacked` + `reg_root_E`) + **operator-set-diversity vouch** (R-08 / Attack B; 1-of-N-honest), CANNOT table (no forge vault spend; no redirect; integrity = backing-safety under open reg; compromised-gk can enable Attack A/B), security-class honesty (trilemma; Corner B **materially weaker**; Corner C **UNSOUND**), competing tokens | §6, §2.1, §2.5 |
| D12 | Operator-set legitimacy: `operator_set_root` as open-registration **policy** in asset_id (default; closed-enumeration alternative only for Corner B); identity vs §4.4 scheduling split; recursive LCP policy-root equality (not bare boolean); two-level epoch admission; `reg_root_E` canonicity = R-04 not in-circuit; Attack A (R-04) vs Attack B (R-08 / genesis enumeration); cross-graph redeem draws in-set vaults only; conditional supply ceiling under the reserve-safety assumptions of §5 (1-of-N + R-04 + R-08/genesis + ≥1 honest challenger; broken by Attack A, Attack B, **or** unchallenged fraudulent reimbursement) (§3.6) | §3.1.2, §3.3(e), §3.3.1, §3.6, §4.1.2, §4.3 |
| D13 | Open operator registration market: permissionless join per epoch, bond/PoP/`reg_root_E`/MuSig2 KeyAgg/bounded restart rounds (per-round deadline ≠ setup window) + two-level ceremony with systematic Level-2→Level-1 escalation (§4.1.2), be-your-own-exit-agent scoped to EXIT, registration-free-reclaim residual → §10.2 | §4.1.1, §4.1.2, §1.2, §4.3.1 |

## Appendix B — Supersession detail

| Prior sketch | Problem | Replacement |
|--------------|---------|-------------|
| Separate `IssuanceProof` / `BurnProof` ProofTypes | Violates single-circuit `C` (§2.2); conflicts with §6.5 version-branch dispatch | TS3 mint / redeem as branches of `C` on v2 surface |
| Global `peg_in_consumed_smt` / `burned_coins_smt` | New consensus objects; incompatible with post-#97 model | Per-deposit `Pk_mint` first-occurrence; redeem ID = `(Pkᵢ, Rᵢ)` |
| `IssuanceTerms_v2_glock_bridged` (issuer-less, version 2) | `issuance_version == 2` is capped-supply; incomplete legitimacy | `IssuanceTerms_v3` with optional gatekeeper + `operator_set_root` + `vault_template` binding |
| Single mandatory issuer (`issuer_pubkey` / REQ-3 monopoly) | Central party; conflates economic mint with quality control | Optional gatekeeper + permissionless minter; `Pk_mint` mode-dependent |
| Federation V0 / BitVM2 intermediate | Superseded by June-2026 Glock decision (historical) | Works-today BitVM2 normative path (§4.0) + integration gate |
| **Glock as normative verifier (not mainnet)** | Not mainnet-proven; designated-verifier challenge | **BitVM2 (mainnet-proven); Glock demoted to §10.1 efficiency upgrade** |
| **`operator_set_root` as fixed key-list / genesis enumeration** | Closed club; not open-operator | Open-registration policy root **by default (product profile)**; closed genesis-enumeration retained as a distinct non-default **Corner-B** policy P′ (materially weaker, no-gatekeeper — §3.1.2) |
| **Permissionless challenging as open dependency (designated-verifier Glock)** | Not available under Glock | **Delivered BitVM2 property (§4.1 role-note (a))** |
| Denominations / `refund_timelock` frozen in asset terms | Economics depend on unaudited projections; asset_id freeze | Bridge-side epoch parameters; start set {0.1, 1, 10}; `refund_timelock` out of terms |
| Fixed `vault_descriptor` in `asset_id` | Circular if asset-bound; cross-asset double-backing if shared | `H(vault_template)` + `instantiate(vault_template, asset_id, agg_key, epoch)` |
| Shallow LCP on user deposit outpoint | Historical inclusion ≠ current vault backing; private-fork refund forgeries | `MoveToBacked` vault outpoint + N-of-N + operator-set + depth ≥ `D_mint` |
| Host-side freshness / mint-window CSV race | Unconstructible mint↔vault co-transition; TOCTOU; tip sentinel ambiguity | Invert: mint proves `MoveToBacked` in-circuit; remove `tip_height`/`W`/`h_inscr`; BitVM2 assert/challenge/disprove CSV only (R-01/R-04 invert; NEW-HOLE-01) |
| `agg_key` as vault internal key | Key-path spend bypasses all CSV locks | NUMS internal key; all spends via CSV-locked pre-signed-graph tapleaves (NUMS / no key-path) |
| Live `agg_key` CHECKSIG leaf on vault | Coalition signs arbitrary vault spend; bypasses fraud statement / connectors; breaks 1-of-N | Pre-signed-graph-only vault spends; setup signatures then keys deleted; no live CHECKSIG (NEW-01) |
| `t < N` vault presigning set | One honest deletion leaves `N−1 ≥ t` shares able to sign; breaks 1-of-N | Vault presigning **MUST** be N-of-N; threshold only for gatekeeper (NEW-01) |
| Depositor / cooperative refund leaf on vault output | `refund_timelock` matures before mint depth; mint-then-refund destroys backing | Refund only on deposit taproot; extinguished by `MoveToBacked`; post-`MoveToBacked` unminted → **irrevocable consented reserve contribution** (INV-01 / R-01) |
| LCP-only canonicity without external observer | Private-fork `MoveToBacked` + mint + canonical refund amortises unbacked supply | Gatekeeper withholds `Pk_mint` until own **canonical Bitcoin view** confirms `MoveToBacked` **and** `reg_root_E` (R-04 extended); open-reg + no-gk + pooled = **Corner C UNSOUND** (trilemma §3.2.1.2) |
| Gatekeeper-only co-sign on `MoveToBacked` | MoveToBacked without depositor consent → unconsented contribution to shared reserve | Depositor co-sign **both modes** (INV-01); gatekeeper co-sign additional in gated mode |
| Bare `operator_set_member_ok` boolean | Attacker proves membership under attacker root | `C_lcp` exposes `operator_set_root`; outer `C` checks equality with asset root (R-02) |
| "Verify full mint proof before signing" | Circular (proof embeds signature) | Gatekeeper verifies inputs, signs, then proof is built (R-03) |
| Literal "consume payout UTXO" | Operator has no key on recipient P2TR | Logical claim-marker first-occurrence on `(Pkᵢ, Rᵢ, payout_txid, payout_vout)` (R-05) |
| Any claim-marker (incl. slashed) blocks uniqueness | Malicious poison-marker freezes honest redeem | Only valid unchallenged markers consume uniqueness; slashed/failed excluded (NEW-02) |
| Claim with one bonded-key input only | Front-runner attaches small bonded input to real operator's funded tx (`SIGHASH_SINGLE\|ANYONECANPAY`) | Value-accounting: sum of bonded-key-signed inputs covers payout + fee; non-bonded inputs value-ignored (NEW-02) |
| "Sort by tapleaf_hash" as full tree pin | BIP-341 sorts only sibling pairs; tree shape underdetermined; NUMS deferred | Fixed leaf order key + left-complete balanced tree-shape rule + pinned NUMS derivation; connector bytes launch-pinned (NEW-03) |
| `C_balance` "unchanged" under v2 `C` | Recursive verifier data embeds `C`; digest must change | Both `C` and `C_balance` re-pinned for v2 (M-02) |
| Exact aggregate supply from chain data | Vaulted-unminted / slot-burn indistinguishable | Upper bound only; optional aggregate attestation (M-04) |
| Reimbursement without value preservation / payout bind | Vault drain or historical payout replay | Exactly `redeem_amount` from vault; claim-marker on payout `(txid,vout)`; `max_fee < redeem_amount` (NH-01..03) |
| Watchtower floor alone (no PA) | One-shot exhaustion across sequential claims | Per-operator sequencing connectors + floor over operators |
| Self-controlled N-of-N under permissionless mint | 1-of-N honesty vacuous; unbacked cross-graph redeem | `operator_set_root` policy bound in `asset_id` + recursive `C_lcp.operator_set_root` equality (foreign-root) + anti-domination + **R-08** diversity vouch in gated mode (Attack B — §3.1.2) |
| two-level admission asserted but registration mechanism undefined | In-circuit checks reference `reg_root_E`/`agg_key_E` without formation rules | §4.1.2 registration/bond/PoP/KeyAgg/ceremony spec |
| R-04 conflated with self-controlled-vault drain | Private-fork canonicity mis-credited for Sybil-epoch drain | **R-08** operator-set-diversity vouch closes Attack B; R-04 is Attack A only |
| no-gatekeeper open-registration pooled cross-graph treated as merely weaker | Understated residual; economic bond alone insufficient | stated **unsound** (Attack B); sound-deployment **trilemma** (Corner A = zkBTC / Corner B = closed-set materially weaker / Corner C = UNSOUND — §3.2.1.2) |
| trilemma Corner B (no-gk closed set) mislabeled 'sound' → materially weaker (Attack A operator-oracle-only); no clean no-gatekeeper pooled profile exists | Closing the operator set closes Attack B only, not Attack A (private-fork); Corner B was over-claimed as sound | Corner B = **materially weaker (Attack A operator-oracle-only), not clean**; two-attack decomposition (A = R-04; B = R-08 / genesis enumeration); trust-minimized pooled reserve **REQUIRES** gatekeeper for both; §3.2.1.2 / §5 / §6.4 |
| `reg_root_E` in-circuit canonicity claim | Contradicted §3.4 (LCP cannot prove canonicity); completeness mis-framed as safety | Gatekeeper-anchored canonicity (R-04 covers `MoveToBacked` **and** `reg_root_E`); completeness = liveness residual; Attack-B safety = R-08 (§4.1.2) |
| no-gatekeeper same-epoch reimbursement escape | Unconstructible (`redeem_commitment` has no epoch field; vault-outpoint binding ruled out §3.5.5) and insufficient (multi-vault Sybil epoch still cross-graph vulnerable) | Sound-deployment **trilemma** (Corner A recommended/clean; Corner B materially weaker Attack-A operator-oracle-only; Corner C forbidden/UNSOUND; no fully-clean no-gatekeeper pooled profile) |
| ceremony exclusion silently reused old partials | Exclusion changes `agg_key_E` (KeyAgg over reduced set); old MuSig2 nonces/partials/graph artifacts invalid; "completes over subset" overclaimed | Bounded restart rounds within setup window (per-round deadline ≠ setup window) + two-level ceremony (Level 1 epoch-set / Level 2 per-deposit); Level-1 griefing → slash-and-restart; one-off Level-2 → deposit-taproot refund; systematic Level-2 → Level-1 exclusion |
| compromised gatekeeper "never steal" overclaim | Same breath admitted Attack B re-open (backing drain) yet claimed never-steal | Integrity under open registration is **backing-safety dependency** via R-08 (enables Attack B); still cannot forge vault spend, freeze, or block exit (REQ-4) |
| supply ceiling conditioned only on Attack A/B → also conditional on ≥1 honest challenger (unchallenged fraudulent reimbursement is a third counterexample) — §3.6/§5 | Incomplete ceiling residual | Ceiling holds under §5 reserve-safety (1-of-N + R-04 + R-08/genesis + ≥1 honest challenger); broken by Attack A, Attack B, **or** unchallenged fraudulent/duplicate reimbursement |
| 'operators cannot steal' stated unconditionally at ~9 sites → conditioned on ≥1 honest live challenger acting in-window (availability of permissionless challenge ≠ guaranteed action); consistent with §3.6 third drain vector and §5 residual | Unconditional 'cannot steal' / 'never theft' restatements overclaimed relative to BitVM2 optimistic model | Conditioned on 1-of-N + ≥1 honest live challenger acting in-window (§5 residual 3); availability-≠-action stated once (§4.1 role-note (a)); honest-gatekeeper qualifier on §2.2/§6.3 forge/mint-unbacked rows |
| 'critical bug → only freeze/burn, not theft' stated unconditionally (§4.5) | Conflated a non-soundness bug's freeze/burn outcome with a circuit/graph soundness bug's theft risk; contradicted §5 'sound BitVM2 crypto' condition | Split by bug class: non-soundness bug = freeze/burn under 1-of-N + sound crypto; circuit/graph **soundness** bug can enable theft (§5 sound-crypto condition); pre-mainnet audit gate (§4.6) closes the soundness class |

*End of design specification. No code. Not a production launch until the §4.6A REQ-4 gates and §4.6B maturity/integration gates clear (two tracks: Plonky2→BitVM2 conversion and open-registration market instantiation); the verifier itself is mainnet-proven.*
